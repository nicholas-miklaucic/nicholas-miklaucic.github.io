I'm Nicholas Miklaucic, a college student studying data science and behavioral neuroscience at Northeastern University.
I went to high school at Phillips Academy Andover, where I participated in and helped run a [[http://2019.pactf.com][cybersecurity competition
for high schoolers]] among other things. I'm interested in math, programming, and how computers can learn from the most
advanced computational system in existenceâ€”the human brain. I hope to make a living in that field. When I'm not doing
those things, I love being in the outdoors, playing and listening to music, and reading.
