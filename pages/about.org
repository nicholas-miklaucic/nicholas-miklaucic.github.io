I'm Nicholas Miklaucic, a college student studying data science at Northeastern University. I went
to high school at Phillips Academy Andover, where I participated and helped run a [[http://2019.pactf.com][cybersecurity
competition for high schoolers]] among other things. I've always loved math and programming, and I
hope to make a living out of them. When I'm not doing those things, I love being in the outdoors,
playing and listening to music, and reading.
