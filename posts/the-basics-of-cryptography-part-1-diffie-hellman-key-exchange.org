How can we send secure messages through insecure channels?

A quick note before we begin: this summarizes a talk I gave at my high school's computer science
club. It's written to be accessible to anyone with a basic math background, though, and it doesn't
require any programming knowledge. This is the start of a series that will try to explain the basics
of cryptography: given that all of us use cryptography every day, it's important to have a basic
understanding of how it works. It's also pretty cool!

{{{TEASER_END}}}

Let's imagine a scenario that more clearly describes what I mean by sending secure messages through
insecure channels:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Alice and Bob live in different cities and want to agree on a meeting place. Their only form of
communication is a telephone line, and they had no communication prior to deciding to meet. However,
Alice discovers that their adversary, Eve, has tapped her phone, and so Eve can listen to any
conversation Alice and Bob have. How can Alice and Bob agree on a place to meet /securely/, such that
Eve, despite listening to the entire conversation, still can't find out where Alice and Bob are
going to meet?
#+END_QUOTE

I'd like to emphasize something: at least to me, this seems completely impossible. Despite the
seeming impossibility, however, a similar process happens so often in the modern world it's
positively mundane! Think of this problem as essentially the analog to wanting to buy something
online and give a credit card number, such that someone watching your Internet connection can't
steal it. We do this all the time! 

This ability to send secure messages through an insecure channel is criminally underappreciated–the
vast majority of what the Internet does today would be impossible without it. The discovery of these
techniques should, in my view, be considered equally important to the modern world as the
iPhone. (Would the iPhone be very useful if you couldn't be sure you were downloading the app you
wanted or visiting the website you wanted to visit?)

So how does this work? The complete picture will take several posts to develop. We're going to start
with historical developments and use that framework to see what computers bring to the table. Then,
in this post, we'll cover how the secret sauce that computers bring actually works.

* Terminology
I want to briefly introduce some terminology which will make the rest of this easier to explain. A
prior secret way of sending information, of the kind that you might expect Alice and Bob to need, is
called a /prior channel/. The type channel Alice and Bob are stuck with, one with eavesdroppers, is
called a /public channel./ Secret information that a code, or /cipher/, uses is called a /key/. With a key
and a cipher, we can take /plaintext/, the unencrypted information, and turn it into /ciphertext/,
encrypted information.

With that out of the way, let's get started! So how did people send secret messages in the past?

* History
Pre-modern efforts in cryptography were based around a different situation than the one I just
described: there /is/ a prior channel, but it's temporary, and you want to send messages on an
public channel afterwards.

Classic efforts to do this are based in what we now call /security through obscurity/: "tricks" that
rely on a secret method that Alice and Bob share but Eve doesn't. For example, the /Caesar cipher/
rotates letters through the alphabet, so A might go to C, B to D, C to E, and so on, wrapping
around. 

The most famous example of this type of code in the 20th century is the /Enigma machine/, a mechanized
way of sending messages that used a complicated series of transpositions and such based on
configurations that were given in pre-distributed books with keys. The knowledge of how to operate
the machines and those configurations needed to be distributed secretly, but then any message could
be sent in the field over public channels.

As you might know, these methods don't perform as advertised. It is possible for an adversary, after
seeing enough messages, to decode future messages without codebooks or any other secret
information. Famously, the Enigma machine was broken using early computers and the work of
mathematicians and scientists at Bletchley Park, which significantly benefitted the Allied war
effort. Caesar ciphers (and transposition ciphers more generally, where symbols are replaced in some
uniform pattern) can also be broken through /frequency analysis/: the most common letters in English
text are, roughly in order, ETAOINSHRDLCU, and comparing the most frequent symbols in the /ciphertext/
(the coded message) to these letters and trying to find common words is usually enough to break them.

* Doing Better
To get from these codes—methods that require a /prior channel/ and are still insecure—to methods that
are (to our knowledge!) secure and don't require this prior channel will require computers. Modern
cryptography (at least, sending secret messages) is broken down into two steps: agreeing on a shared
cryptographic key, and using a cipher to send information using that key. We'll be focusing on the
first step, because doing that key sharing through a public channel is what lets modern cryptography
depart from the old, Enigma-style way of doing things. This problem is called /key exchange/. (The
ciphers that you can use once you have a secret key, the digital versions of the Enigma machine, are
called /symmetric-key ciphers/. They're not actually that interesting from a mathematical perspective:
they're usually not built around simple mathematical problems like key exchange, and they're often
just basically a really souped-up version of something like the Enigma machine rather than a
completely different approach to the problem.)

* Peter and Natasha
Secure key exchange over a public channel seems...really hard, if not impossible. Surely if someone
can listen to everything you say, you can't tell someone a secret without them hearing it? I find it
helpful to have analog analogies for these concepts, so let's start with a story much like the one
about Alice and Bob:

{{{mn}}}
The way this was told to me was with a stock Russian accent: feel free to add that to your own
narration.
{{{mn-end}}}

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Peter and Natasha live in the Soviet Union: Peter lives in Moscow, and Natasha lives in
Leningrad. They are lovers, and Peter wants to send Natasha a necklace to demonstrate his
love. Unfortunately, the Postal Service is corrupt: the workers at the Service will readily steal
anything of value in the parcels they send, including a necklace like Peter's. Peter and Natasha
both own secure padlocks, but the Postal Service workers are extraordinarily crafty: even if you
send a key and a lock in separate parcels, they will keep the key and use it to open the locked
parcel. How can Peter send his necklace to Natasha, in such a way that the Postal Service can't ever
take the necklace?
#+END_QUOTE

This is a fun puzzle to think about, and if you're so inclined I'd recommend thinking about it for a
while and coming back. I'll wait!

OK, so how do Peter and Natasha fix this problem? There's a particularly clever solution:
1. Peter puts the necklace in a box, locks it with his padlock, and sends it to Natasha.
2. Natasha puts her own lock on the box and sends it back to Peter.
3. Peter unlocks his lock and sends it back to Natasha: it still has Natasha's lock, so the Postal
   Service can't open it.
4. Natasha unlocks her lock and can then open the parcel.

This is pretty much exactly what we need! The one difference is that, instead of physical padlocks,
we need some digital version of this idea: something you can do to a number that only you can
undo. That's what we'll need to figure out now, before we can apply this technique. (Even though we
often think of data as text or images, to computers it's really just numbers: all we're going to
look at is sending numerical information.)

* One-Way Functions
What we're describing is called a /one-way function/: some function $f$ such that computing $f(x)$ is
easy, but finding the $x$ for some $y$ such that $f(x) = y$ is hard. I'm not really going to worry
about what easy and hard mean in this context for now, but we'll assume that our eavesdropper has
much better computers than we do. Because of that, we'd really like a solution to this where we can
create arbitrarily large /work factors/: the ratio between the computing power needed to encode
something and the computing power needed to crack it. 

A quick disclaimer: it's actually unknown whether one-way functions really exist in the sense I'm
talking about them! (If you're familiar with $P = NP$, a famous unsolved problem in computer
science, the answer hinges on that problem.) So, whenever I say "one-way function", just mentally
substitute "functions that people have spent fifty years trying to undo easily and haven't found any
success in doing" and we'll be good.

* The Discrete Logarithm Problem
The one-way function we'll be looking at, because it's commonly used and easy to understand compared
to others, is the /discrete logarithm problem/, specifically the one about /modular exponentiation./
Let's dive in!

Modular arithmetic, as you might know, is math where you only look at integers in terms of their
remainder when divided by some number. For example, modulo 3, 6 and 9 are both congruent to 0, and 7
is congruent to 1. 

Modular multiplication seems like a good candidate for a one-way function: computing that $5 \times 7
\equiv 2 \pmod{11}$ (because 35 has a remainder of 2 when divided by 11) and figuring out "what number,
when multiplied by 7, gives 2 modulo 11?" don't seem equally hard. Unfortunately, this isn't really
true. Specifically, finding the /modular multiplicative inverse/ of a number (its reciprocal, or the
number that when multiplied by it gives 1) is pretty quick using something called the /extended/
/Euclidean algorithm./ I'm not going to go into it here, but suffice it to say that this doesn't
really work.

You might next try /modular exponentiation/: this /does/ work as a one-way function. First, let's think
about how the powers of a number look when we do them modulo some other number. (Due to the way
modular arithmetic works, we don't need to keep track of what the powers would be normally: we
can just multiply the last number in the sequence by our base and take the remainder.) 

{{{mn}}}
If it ever got to $0$, it would just stay there forever. Luckily, this won't ever happen,
because that would mean $7$ evenly divides a power of $3$. But $7$ is prime, so it doesn't divide
any numbers besides itself and $1$: no power of $3$ will ever have a $7$ in its prime
factorization.
{{{mn-end}}}

For example, the powers of $2$ modulo $7$ are $2, 4, 1, 2, \dots$: they repeat. This is actually a
problem for us, because it kinda limits our options. Let's look at the powers of $3$ modulo $7$,
though: we get $3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 3, \dots$, which covers every number there is modulo $7$ except
$0$. 

We call these numbers, like $3$ modulo $7$, /primitive roots/: their powers go through all of the
possible values. Generating primitive roots is a bit outside the scope of this post, but it suffices
to say that they exist and we can find them for any prime modulus like $7$.

Right now, there's nothing different between the way we're doing modular exponentiation, with lots
of multiplications, and how we'd do the inverse (called the /discrete logarithm/): we're just doing
lots of multiplying by 3. Anyone could just do lots of divisions by $3$ (or just straight-up
generate this sequence of powers the same way we're doing it) and invert our answer roughly as fast
as we made it.

Luckily, there's a trick that makes modular exponentation faster than this. Let's scale up a bit and
pretend we're doing math modulo $61$ (a prime: that's important). We can use $2$ as our base because
it's a primitive root for $61$.

What's a fast way to compute, say, $2^{16}$ modulo $61$? (Pretend these exponents and moduli are
/enormous/, like 200 digits long, and we don't want to do that many multiplications.) Instead of the
normal $16$ multiplications we'd have to do, we can cheat and save some steps. Take our base, $2$,
and square it to get $2^2 \equiv 4$, doing everything modulo $61$. Square that to get $(2^2)^2 = 2^4
\equiv 16$. Square that to get $2^8 \equiv 16 \times 16 \equiv 12$, and finally square that to get $2^{16}
\equiv 12 \times 12 \equiv 22$. Each squaring is a single multiplication, and so we only have to square four
times. Essentially, we have to do $\log_2 e$ multiplications to raise a base to power $e$, because
each squaring doubles the exponent.

Note that it's most efficient when the exponent is very close to a power of $2$, and so figuring out
how efficient it is in general is a little more complicated, but it's always significantly faster
than the naive method of exponentiation.

Could someone given the opposite problem—"$2$ to what exponent modulo $61$ gives $22$?"—also use
this strategy? The answer is no: if you don't know that the answer is above $16$, you won't know
that you didn't miss the answer by squaring $4$ times. Essentially, someone trying to invert this
can only use the table of exponents we had before this. 

This problem is called the /discrete logarithm problem/, and it's the digital version of a key that we
need for this problem. With this in mind, let's see a version of the Peter and Natasha solution that
uses this method. One thing we can cut out is the part where Peter and Natasha unlock their locks:
all we care about is that we share /some/ secret, not any particular one.

* The Diffie-Hellman-Merkle Key Exchange Algorithm
This algorithm is usually just called /Diffie-Hellman key exchange/, but Ralph Merkle should really
get more of the credit. Our setup is that Alice and Bob want to agree on a secret number over a
public channel without an eavesdropper, Eve, being able to see it.

1. Alice and Bob publicly agree on a modulus $p$, some prime number like $61$, and a primitive root
   $e$, like $2$.
2. Alice and Bob individually pick a random number modulo $p$. They keep this to themselves. Let's
   call Alice's number $a$ and Bob's number $b$.
3. Alice computes $e^a \pmod p$ and sends it to Bob. Because the discrete logarithm problem is hard to
   solve, Eve can't figure out what $a$ is, although she knows what $e$ and $p$ are. Neither can
   Bob, but he won't need to.
4. Bob does the same thing, sending $e^b \pmod p$ to Alice. Eve also can't figure out what Bob's
   secret is.
5. Bob takes the number $e^a$ that Alice sent him and raises that number by his secret number $b$ to
   get $(e^a)^b \pmod p = e^{ab} \pmod p$.
6. Alice does the same thing, raising Bob's number $e^b$ to her secret number $a$ to get $(e^b)^a \pmod
   p = e^{ab} \pmod p$.
7. Because exponentiation is commutative like this, now Alice and Bob both know a secret: $e^{ab} \pmod
   p$. This secret number is something Eve can't know, even if she's listened to all of their
   communications!

There's something wonderfully brazen about this strategy: you can very loudly proclaim how you're
going to share your secret, and no one can stop you, even if they know exactly how you're doing
it. This is why open-source code, where you can freely download it, is often /preferred/ for
cryptography: these methods don't rely on security through obscurity, and so even if you reveal the
trick no one can stop you.

Note that the numbers used are really big: computers can still easily solve the problem with numbers
like $61$. Note that the base of the exponent doesn't actually need to be large, and numbers like
$2$ and $3$ are fine for the most part in practice. (Of course, if you don't do enough
exponentiation to wrap over the modulus at least once, you can easily break it by just doing normal
logarithms.) The prime number used as the modulus, $p$, is in modern applications often $1024$ or
$2048$ bits: the number itself, written out in base 10, can be hundreds of digits. At these scales,
even with supercomputers trying to break it, this encryption method is secure.

* Conclusion
Let's zoom out for a second. Until around 1970, any encryption method was reliant on the secrecy of
the method itself or some prior secret key, and most of those methods were breakable (and,
eventually, broken). There has been a massive paradigm shift in the past fifty years: now, securely
sending messages is possible even when the method you use is completely public and you have no prior
communication with the person you want to communicate to. The modern Internet is reliant on
techniques like this to operate. 

If nothing else, I hope this increases your appreciation for the usefulness of some branches of math
that aren't often discussed as having practical applications. Cryptography is in an odd spot in the
world of applied math: for millennia, number theory and prime numbers were considered the purest of
pure math, studied for their beauty and elegance rather than real-world applications, but all of a
sudden in the past fifty years research in number theory has developed very important national
security applications. I have a very firm ethos that predicting what knowledge will be useful in the
future is nigh-impossible, and so learning for its own sake and seeing where that takes you is often
just as important as following set courses of study. The namesake algorithm of this blog, [[https://nicholas-miklaucic.github.io/posts/hello-world/][explained
in my first post]], is another example of pure math finding applications in cryptography.


One last caveat before you're finally done reading this: /if you're a programmer, and you ever write/
/code that does any of this yourself for any real-world application, stop./ Actually implementing
these ideas and making sure that there aren't any ways of circumventing the math is really, really
hard, and the people who are qualified to write this code are few and far between. Using a library
someone else wrote is basically always more secure than doing it yourself.

Next time, I'll look at another absolutely essential algorithm to the operation of the modern world:
the /RSA cryptosystem./ This set of algorithms allows you to verify your identity, securely sign a
message, and provide another way of achieving the type of encryption that we discussed here, by
letting anyone encrypt messages that only a single person can decrypt. See you then!
