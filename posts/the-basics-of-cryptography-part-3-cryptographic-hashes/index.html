<p>
We&#8217;re previously discussed cryptography, in the modern world, as a way of sending secure messages
through insecure channels. But this is not the only thing you might want to do in a world with
malicious actors trying to thwart you. RSA and Diffie-Hellman exchange aren&#8217;t vulnerable to simple
eavesdroppers. However, there are other types of attacks that they don&#8217;t protect against, and we
might want to insulate ourselves against those attacks as well. One of them is a <i>man-in-the-middle</i>
attack—in essence, someone manipulating messages. As we&#8217;ve often done, let&#8217;s imagine a scenario, the one
I ended the last post&nbsp;with:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Alice and Bob are organizing anti-government activism in a country that represses political
freedoms. Alice wants to tell Bob to meet her in a certain place, but they can only communicate over
the Internet: Bob worries that Malcolm, the government employee that controls their Internet
provider, will forge a message from Alice and set him up. How can Bob verify that Alice&#8217;s messages
haven&#8217;t been&nbsp;modified?
</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<span class="marginnote"><p>
</p>
<p>
RSA can be modified to work for identity verification, but not in the way we&#8217;ve discussed it. That&#8217;s
why it&#8217;s sometimes called a <i>cryptosystem.</i>
</p>
</span>

<p>
Note that RSA and Diffie-Hellman can&#8217;t help us here. To see why, realize that Malcolm can simply
intercept all of their communications, impersonating Alice to Bob and Bob to Alice. He can forward
any message, and for Diffie-Hellman he can set up his own secret with both Alice and Bob and forward
all messages through that channel. Alice and Bob have no way of ever knowing that this&nbsp;happened!
</p>

<p>
The solution to this problem, along with lots of other cryptography solutions, is easiest to
implement with a new <i>cryptographic primitive</i>. A primitive is a tool in our toolbox: a single thing
we can chain and combine in interesting ways to create the desired kind of security. We&#8217;ve already
seen &#8220;sharing a single secret&#8221; or &#8220;sending a message securely&#8221; as primitives. Today we&#8217;re going to
add one&nbsp;more.

<h2 id="orgf79cf43">Cheating a&nbsp;Little</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf79cf43">
<p>
The actual math of hash functions isn&#8217;t very interesting, at least to me, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s
very illuminating to the student. The <i>application</i> of hash functions, however, is fascinating, and
readily accessible. Because of that, I&#8217;m not going to be covering how hash functions actually
work. Instead, I&#8217;ll just describe the properties of a good hash function and assume that some&nbsp;exist.
</p>

<p>
A lot of cryptography assumes this: just like RSA, we usually can&#8217;t prove that these functions truly
fulfill their goals, but we can reasonably hope that they are. When hash functions are broken—i.e.,
their security guarantees fail to hold—the cryptography that depends on them also breaks. The Flame
malware that attacked Iran in 2012, for example, used a bad hash function to impersonate Microsoft:
this let it gain administrator privileges on Windows without the user&#8217;s&nbsp;knowledge.

<h2 id="org5cfc814">What Properties Do Hash Functions&nbsp;Have?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5cfc814">
<p>
Most cryptographic hash functions take in input of any size and output a fixed number of bits. A
function \(f\) is a <i>cryptographic hash function</i> if it satisfies the&nbsp;following:
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orge35a7ee" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge35a7ee">Determinism</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge35a7ee">
<p>
\(f\) is a function in the mathematical sense: it always produces the same output for the same
input. Note that the reverse is always false: because hash functions can take in input of any size
but have limited possible outputs, there are always some inputs that have the same&nbsp;hash.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org8b7f2d1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8b7f2d1">Irreversibility</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8b7f2d1">
<p>
Given an output \(y\), it is computationally infeasible to find any input \(x\) such
that \(f(x) = y\). (In practice, this translates to &#8220;no strategy significantly
better than random guessing&nbsp;exists.&#8221;)
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgcd0dd2b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgcd0dd2b">Collision&nbsp;Resistance</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgcd0dd2b">
<p>
Not only can the function not be easily inverted, but it is infeasible to find <i>any</i> two inputs that
map to any output: any \(x_1, x_2\), and \(y\) such that \(f(x_1) = f(x_2) = y\). Such a pair of inputs
would be called a <i>collision</i>. Again, because hash functions map any input to a limited range of
outputs, collisions always exist, but ideally they&#8217;re impossible to produce on&nbsp;demand.
</p>

<p>
There&#8217;s one requirement that isn&#8217;t usually technically part of the definition, but is often
required. It doesn&#8217;t have an easy name, but I&#8217;ll&nbsp;try:
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org4a2c10f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4a2c10f">Maximal&nbsp;Entropy</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4a2c10f">
<p>
\(f\) should reveal as little information as possible, known in information theory has having maximal
entropy. Hash functions should look random: learning <i>anything</i> about an input given its hash should
be infeasible, and any sequence of hashes should look&nbsp;random.
</p>

<p>
This is often stated as saying the function <i>avalanches</i>. If two inputs \(x\) and \(x&#8217;\) differ by even a
single bit, their hashes should be completely uncorrelated: each bit in the output should be
independent of each&nbsp;other.

hashed with <code>SHA256</code> and then converted to&nbsp;hexadecimal:

</pre></div>

<p>
Even though this is just counting up in binary, each output looks completely different. This is a
good way of building intuition as to what the properties I described above mean. Loosely, hash
functions should feel random but not actually <i>be</i>&nbsp;random.
</p>

<p>
Alright, so let&#8217;s say we have a hash function. What can we do with&nbsp;it?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga087cf0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga087cf0">Application 1: Message&nbsp;Integrity</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga087cf0">
<p>
Our opening problem about Alice and Bob meeting up despite Malcolm&#8217;s interference is actually
several separate problems. The one I want to focus on is preventing tampering. In plain RSA, for
example, any attacker can add as much as they&#8217;d like to any message, even without being able to
decrypt it, by simply adding numbers on the end. (This is called a <i>length</i> <i>extension attack.</i>)
Many cryptography systems like the basic version of RSA are also <i>malleable</i>, meaning that you can
change the message without being able to decrypt it. For example, in RSA if two numbers \(m_1\) and
\(m_2\) encrypt to ciphertexts \(c_1\) and \(c_2\), then the encryption of \(m_1m_2\) is just \(c_1c_2\) (all
modulo \(n\)). How can you prevent people from messing with your message in this&nbsp;way?
</p>

<p>
Hashes provide a solution. All Alice has to do is end her messages by hashing them and including
that hash with the message. Now any alteration of the message itself will be detected: the hash of
the altered message won&#8217;t line up with the included hash. Without decrypting the message, which is
infeasible, Malcolm has no way of altering the message without Bob&#8217;s&nbsp;knowledge.
</p>

<p>
A quick note: hash functions are often used to check message integrity for more mundane reasons than
espionage: it&#8217;s good to know if your Internet worked properly! These are usually called <i>checksums</i>
instead. For example, installing a Linux distro to your computer requires complete trust of the
website you download it from: a malicious actor could add code to the operating system that did all
sorts of nefarious things. Because of this, Linux distribution maintainers make sure to publish
checksums that are separate from the file itself. That way, you can be sure that you downloaded the
file correctly and that no one messed with it before you&nbsp;install.
</p>

<p>
We can go further: imagine now that instead of just hashing the current message, you hash the entire
message history up until that point as well, including the previous hashes! This means that, if
Alice and Bob ever have different ideas of what their message history is, they&#8217;ll know that someone
has forged a message or prevented one from being sent: even something as simple as sending messages
in a different order can be detected. You could do this by including the actual entire message
history without hashing, but that would be prohibitively large and easier to mess&nbsp;with.
</p>

<span class="marginnote">
<p>
If you&#8217;re interested in learning more about this, the exact system I just described is
called a <i>Merkle tree</i>.
</p>
</span>

<p>
Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin couldn&#8217;t exist without hashing: they use a scheme similar to the one I
described above to make each record of a transaction depend on all of the previous
transactions. Modifying this ledger requires you to recalculate all of the future transactions,
which is prohibitively&nbsp;difficult.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org0f6f236" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0f6f236">Application 2: Proof of&nbsp;Work</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0f6f236">
<p>
Speaking of Bitcoin, it uses hashing for a completely separate application as well. Let&#8217;s say you
want to make adding a transaction to the global ledger (i.e., recording that you paid me fifty
bucks) difficult, much in the same way mining precious metals is. This difficulty introduces
scarcity that makes the currency hold value and prevents people simply faking their account&nbsp;balance.
</p>

<span class="marginnote">
<p>
This is a little simplified: Bitcoin in practice is somewhat complicated. This is the essential idea
behind the system, however, and I think it&#8217;s more useful to know that than it is to be able to
implement it yourself when there are already plenty of good implementations out&nbsp;there.
</p>
</span>

<p>
A good hash function should be more or less random, so finding outputs with any particular property
is a difficult problem that&#8217;s easy to verify. For example, if I make a new currency, I could say
that in order to publish a transaction you need to publish an input that, when you add it to the end
of the transaction&#8217;s data, hashes to an output with 16 zeros at the start of its binary
representation. If the hash I pick isn&#8217;t possible to reverse-engineer, even in cases like this where
I only need to reverse-engineer part of the output, then doing this requires running, on average,
\(2^{16} = 65536\) hashes. I can set the number of zeroes needed to whatever I want to make publishing
transactions as hard as I&#8217;d like. Because transactions include a record of all of the previous
hashes, like we just discussed, if I were to try and modify the existing ledger of transactions I
would have to redo all of the work that was put into it from the point I want to change forward: if
I just modified the data directly, anyone who recomputed the hashes would see that they didn&#8217;t start
with enough zeroes or have whatever other special property the network agrees on. Because I require
that you hash something that includes the transaction history, I can also prevent people from
precomputing these hashes: because combining two pieces of data doesn&#8217;t easily translate to
combining their hashes, there&#8217;s no effective way of &#8220;getting&nbsp;ahead.&#8221;
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5030cca" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5030cca">Application 3: Password&nbsp;Verification</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5030cca">
<p>
I&#8217;m pretty sure that you have used a password before. Passwords provide a useful way of verifying
your identity. However, there&#8217;s a significant problem with basic passwords: if I tell you my
password, you can now impersonate me and there&#8217;s not much I can do about&nbsp;it.
</p>

<p>
Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re running a website that needs users to authenticate. If you store people&#8217;s
passwords, then if someone hacks your database they can impersonate any user and you can&#8217;t really do
anything about&nbsp;it.
</p>

<p>
Enter hashes! Instead of doing this, you can store the <i>hash</i> of each user&#8217;s password in a database.
When someone wants to authenticate, you hash whatever they give you and then check it against your
database. If it matches, then they&#8217;ve proven that they know their password without the need to
actually store what that password is. Even if someone hacks your database, they can&#8217;t actually
impersonate a user, because reversing any of those hashes should be difficult. This is why choosing
good passwords is important! A lot of websites, contrary to best practice, use very fast hash
functions. If a hacker can run a million hashes a second, it doesn&#8217;t take that long to check every
word in the dictionary, every combination of letters up to 8 characters, or every password in the
list of the top 100,000 most&nbsp;common.
</p>

<p>
One important thing to do to make this system secure is to add a <i>salt</i> to the password before
hashing it: some fixed data that is added each time. This prevents what are known evocatively as
<i>rainbow tables</i>: simply spending a ton of time computing all of the hashes of passwords up to some
amount of characters and then storing all of them. Then, you can simply look up hashes in that table
instead of having to do all of that work every&nbsp;time.
</p>

<p>
There&#8217;s a good practical application of this knowledge even if you aren&#8217;t a programmer. <i>Any</i>
<i>website that emails you your password if you forget it is not trustworthy!</i> The reason reset links
are used when you forget a password isn&#8217;t because website administrators want to inconvenience
people, it&#8217;s because they honestly don&#8217;t know what your password was. Even the website itself can&#8217;t
reverse-engineer their hashes, and so the only way to reset a password is to pick a new one and then
overwrite the old hash with the new&nbsp;one.
</p>

<span class="marginnote">
<p>
This is why I&#8217;m so infuriated by maximum-length requirements on passwords! All outputs of a hash
have the same size, so it&#8217;s not for any technical reason: it would be trivial in a well-designed
system to let you have 400-character passwords. It&#8217;s meant to prevent easy-to-guess longer
passwords, but having predictable long passwords is way more secure than very unpredictable short&nbsp;ones.)

<div id="outline-container-org01ad4a0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org01ad4a0">A Brief Non-Cryptographic&nbsp;Postlude</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org01ad4a0">
<p>
Hashes are useful in all kinds of ways, not just cryptography, and I would be remiss to not at least
briefly go over some of the interesting ways they can be&nbsp;used.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgb6fd9c2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb6fd9c2">Hashmaps</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb6fd9c2">
<p>
Let&#8217;s say you want to store a mapping from a person&#8217;s username to their password hash like I
described above. What&#8217;s the best way to do that? One solution is to have, for example, 256 &#8220;buckets&#8221;
numbered 0-255. When you want to store a username-hash pair, hash the username and take the first 8
bits of the hash. That number, which is 0-255, is the &#8220;bucket&#8221; you store the hash&nbsp;in.
</p>

<p>
This system requires some cleverness to actually implement: you have to deal with what happens if
two inputs map to the same bucket, and you have to manage the tradeoff between having lots of
buckets (which is wasteful for small numbers of keys) and having lots of collisions (which is
wasteful because no system for dealing with collisions doesn&#8217;t have at least a little overhead or
wasted space.) However, this is a much, much more efficient way of doing things than keeping a list
of key-value pairs, because getting a value from a key doesn&#8217;t require searching the entire list of&nbsp;values.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org2170193" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2170193">Equality</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2170193">
<p>
We discussed earlier using checksums as a way of quickly checking that two big pieces of data are
equal. This can be used to prevent tampering, but it&#8217;s also useful in applications that require
equality checking for large datasets as part as normal operation. Version control systems that allow
multiple people to merge changes to the same files rely on hashes as an identifier for different
versions: if the hash of my working directory and yours differ, then one of us made a change&nbsp;somewhere.
</p>

<p>
A somewhat niche use that I&#8217;ll mention here is in chess AI. It&#8217;s a timesaver, when calculating chess
positions, to remember if you&#8217;ve already seen a position before and analyzed it. To do this, chess
AI programs use a hash function to compare different boards because it&#8217;s faster than checking it&nbsp;piece-by-piece.
</p>

<p>
The reason I mention this is because, as far as I know, version control systems have never run into
any problems with hash collisions that weren&#8217;t from malicious actors. If two different versions were
to have the same hash, it would completely break the system, but to my knowledge this has never
happened unintentionally. This <i>has</i> happened for the smaller hashes used in chess AI,&nbsp;however!
</p>

<p>
Specifically, the game <a href="https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1352348">Pablo Lafuente vs. Shredder (2005)</a> features a bizarre error where, on move
18, the computer Shredder (which would only lose this game in the tournament) trades bishops but
just…doesn&#8217;t recapture the piece, a blindingly obvious blunder that cost it the game. This is
believed to be a hash collision: for some reason Shredder thought that the given position was
equivalent to a different one and played the wrong&nbsp;move.

<div id="outline-container-org80c1b7e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org80c1b7e">Bloom&nbsp;Filters</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org80c1b7e">
<p>
This sort of probabilistic tradeoff, where you accept the risk of an occasional error for speed,
comes up a lot with hash functions. One cool data structure that uses this is called a <i>Bloom
filter.</i> Let&#8217;s say you want something like a hashmap, but even faster, and the only thing you care
about is quickly computing whether some input has already been&nbsp;seen.
</p>

<p>
One solution is to store a list of, say, 256 bits. When you want to mark that you&#8217;ve seen an input,
you hash it with, say, 3 different hashes and get the first 8 bits from each. This results in 3
numbers between 0 and 255. Set each of those bits in the filter to&nbsp;1.
</p>

<p>
If you hash an input and all of the bits you would flip are already 1, you&#8217;ve <i>probably</i> seen this
input before. Sometimes, however, you&#8217;ll get unlucky and you&#8217;ll have flipped each bit of the filter
you checked using a different input. If any of the bits you would flip are 0, however, then you&#8217;ve
<i>definitely</i> not seen the input before. You can tune how many hashes you use and how any bits you
keep in the filter to get the right tradeoff between space, accuracy, and&nbsp;efficiency.
</p>

<p>
This is often combined with a deterministic system that&#8217;s slower but guaranteed to be correct in
cases where in most cases whatever you&#8217;re looking up isn&#8217;t in the database. For example, if you want
to block ads from certain URLs in a large list that&#8217;s not locally stored, it&#8217;s wasteful to get that
list from the Internet each time you want to check a URL, because most URLs aren&#8217;t ads. You can
combine this list with a locally-stored Bloom filter to very quickly eliminate the majority of URLs:
because Bloom filters are always right if they give a negative answer, this will never result in ads
being mistakenly shown: occasionally, you&#8217;ll query the list over the Internet and see that the URL
isn&#8217;t an ad, but that&#8217;s an acceptable tradeoff for space and&nbsp;speed.

Whew, where was I? Like you might be starting to surmise, hash functions are used everywhere in
computer science and cryptography. They&#8217;re an extraordinarily useful tool in all sorts of
situations. They do introduce another possible weak point in a cryptographic system, but as long as
the programmer chooses a secure hash function and replaces it when/if it&#8217;s found to be insecure
they&#8217;re usually decently&nbsp;secure.
</p>

<p>
Hash functions, asymmetric encryption, and key exchange are three extremely important fundamentals
to a wide variety of cryptographic applications. Now that all three have been written up here, in
the future this series will be more of a survey of interesting applications of these tools than
adding new primitives. I don&#8217;t know what that will look like, but stay&nbsp;tuned!

I hope that this series has helped readers appreciate the ingenuity of the systems that we take for
granted when we use the Internet or digitally sign a paper. Today&#8217;s world is so specialized that
it&#8217;s difficult to understand much about the things we use. We can drive without understanding
catalytic converters, use microwaves without knowing anything about radiation, and take medicines
without knowing how they work. I hope that this series helps demystify a small part of the
environment that surrounds us. Thanks for reading, and see you next&nbsp;time!
