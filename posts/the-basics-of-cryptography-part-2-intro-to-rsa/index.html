This is part 2 of a series: to see the first post, go <a href="https://nicholas-miklaucic.github.io/posts/the-basics-of-cryptography-part-1-diffie-hellman-key-exchange/">here.</a> If you&#8217;re not familiar with things like
modular arithmetic, read that before reading&nbsp;this.
</p>

<p>
Today we&#8217;re going to continue to look behind the curtain at the algorithms that power the Internet
we know and love. In this post, I&#8217;ll cover the RSA cryptosystem: what it is, what it does, how it
works, etc. RSA is such a useful algorithm because it sidesteps a lot of the problems with sending
secure messages we talked about last time. You can think of it as a clever way of improving on the
encryption model we used last time, not by simply improving it as it exists, but by completely
sidestepping the security problems it&nbsp;had.
</p>

<p>
This post will introduce a pristine version of RSA, without the real-world complications, and apply
it to the same problem we looked at last time: securely sending a message to someone else over an
insecure channel, without prior communication. In the future, I&#8217;ll look at how this textbook RSA
fails in the real world, and additionally how you can use the idea behind RSA to do things besides
sending secure&nbsp;messages.

<div id="outline-container-org24b459d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org24b459d">A Brief Historical&nbsp;Prelude</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org24b459d">
<p>
RSA was first published by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (hence the name) in 1977. This came one year
after Diffie-Hellman key exchange: we can essentially think of RSA as an answer to the question that
key exchange posed: &#8220;are there one-way functions that can be used to encrypt messages?&#8221; The goal was
to have some mathematical guarantee of security backed by the difficulty of solving some sort of
problem&nbsp;algorithmically. 
</p>

<p>
RSA encryption is still widely used today, despite lots of alternatives popping up over the past
several decades. I think there are a couple reasons for this: it&#8217;s decently fast, it was first, and
it&#8217;s fairly easy for non-mathematicians to understand. RSA being first is incredibly important:
before its publication, it was unclear if such a method of encryption even existed, and having a
fairly simple mathematical justification for the claim that breaking RSA would require billions of
years to break was enormously&nbsp;appealing.
</p>

<p>
So, with that out of the way, what does RSA do and how does it do&nbsp;it?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbca10b1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgbca10b1">Public-Key&nbsp;Encryption</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbca10b1">
<p>
RSA is a <i>public-key</i> cryptosystem. This means that, instead of a single password or code that can be
used to encrypt and decrypt a message, like the Enigma machine we talked about last time, it&#8217;s
fundamentally <i>asymmetric</i>. You get two keys instead of&nbsp;one:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Your <i>public key</i> is, as the name suggests, something that you share with people you want to
communicate with. It allows anyone to encrypt&nbsp;messages.</li>
<li>Your <i>private key</i> is the opposite: it allows you, and only you, to decrypt any message encrypted
with your public key. This is always kept&nbsp;secret.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This concept can be expanded on and used in more interesting ways, but for now we&#8217;re going to focus
on the simplest example: I want to send Alice a message that only she can read. How can we do&nbsp;this?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org398f259" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org398f259">What&#8217;s the&nbsp;Trick?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org398f259">
<p>
I think a very useful way of thinking about an algorithm is to try and deconstruct it into the
essential component or &#8220;trick&#8221; that makes it work and the components that simply let the essential
insight of the algorithm&nbsp;work.
</p>

<p>
Here, we can decompose RSA into two parts: finding a one-way function that can be used for
public-key encryption, and making sure that you have to actually solve that problem in order to
break the cipher. I don&#8217;t want to make it sound like the last part isn&#8217;t really hard or crucially
important: a bare-bones RSA implementation will have all sorts of flaws that allow an attacker to
completely bypass the actual math problem, and fixing these issues is an essential and interesting
task. <i>However</i>, those parts aren&#8217;t nearly as elegant as the math, and so I&#8217;m not really going to be
going into much detail about how RSA is implemented in&nbsp;practice.
</p>

<p>
So, what one-way function does RSA use? (My caveat from last time still holds: it&#8217;s an open question
whether one-way functions as I describe them exist, and so I&#8217;m using the term to mean &#8220;a function
that, as of writing, is one-way and likely to remain&nbsp;so.&#8221;)
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org44233d6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org44233d6">A Note on&nbsp;Presentation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org44233d6">
<p>
RSA is often presented dryly starting with exactly how you generate keys, decrypt messages, and
encrypt them. I think this approach is a little confusing, because it doesn&#8217;t at all explain how
someone would think to do any of this in the first place. Instead, I&#8217;m going to start with the idea
behind RSA, and only then explain how you actually use that kernel of an idea to actually send
messages. That means that I&#8217;m only going to explain how to actually generate keys at the very end,
so there will be a little magic going on in the next couple sections. Just stick with me: all will
be explained at the&nbsp;end!
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org858edf0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org858edf0">The RSA&nbsp;Problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org858edf0">
<p>
Public-key cryptography is basically advertising a set of problems that only you know the solution
to: anyone with your public key can encrypt a message using a problem in your set, and ideally only
you can solve the problem and then use that to decrypt the message. In that vein, I&#8217;ll present RSA&#8217;s
essential trick as a&nbsp;question:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Given some number \(n = pq\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are prime, a number \(m\), and an exponent \(e\), what
number \(d\) has the property that \((m^e)^d \equiv m \pmod n\), assuming such a number&nbsp;exists?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In RSA, the public key includes \(n\) and \(e\) but not \(m\): this means that you can send any number
between \(0\) and \(n-1\) through RSA, and you can do so as many times as you need to. The solution
doesn&#8217;t change with different values of \(m\), only for different values of \(e\) and&nbsp;\(n\).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8d84f4b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8d84f4b">An&nbsp;Example</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8d84f4b">
<p>
You might very well ask, &#8220;Nicholas, how would we generate \(n, e\), and \(d\) to make this work? Why is
\(n\) a <i>semiprime</i> (the product of two primes)?&#8221; I&#8217;ll get there later. For now, we&#8217;re just going to
look at how, assuming this problem can&#8217;t be solved easily, it lets us implement a public-key system
and lets me send a message to Alice like I wanted to at the start of this&nbsp;post.
</p>

<p>
Let&#8217;s start with a very, very small example, and then work up slightly. Let&#8217;s say I want to send the
number \(12\) (called \(m\) for <i>message</i>) to&nbsp;Alice.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>First, I ask Alice for her public key, which is the pair \((n, e)\). She sends me \((55, 3)\)
back. I don&#8217;t need to worry about how this is generated for&nbsp;now.</li>
<li>I take my message \(m\) and compute \(m^e \pmod n\). In this case, that&#8217;s \(12^3 \equiv 1728 \equiv 23
   \pmod{55}\). This is our <i>ciphertext</i>: the encrypted version of my&nbsp;message.</li>
<li>Alice knows the solution of the problem I posed above. In this case, she knows that the <i>private</i>
<i>key</i> \(d\) is \(7\), for any message, raising it to the third power and then raising that to the
seventh power modulo \(n\) results in the original message. So, to decrypt my message, she computes
\(23^7 \pmod{55} \equiv 12\), which was my original&nbsp;message!</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5d7566d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5d7566d">(Trying to) Break&nbsp;RSA</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5d7566d">
<p>
How might an attacker, who we&#8217;ll call Eve, try to decrypt the message I sent for Alice without
knowing&nbsp;\(d\)? 
</p>

<p>
One approach would be to simply solve the discrete logarithm problem I talked about last time: pick
her own number, say \(5\), encrypt it by computing \(5^3 \mod 55 \equiv 15\), and then trying to find some
exponent \(d\) such that \(15^d \equiv 5 \pmod{55}\). (Because anyone can encrypt messages, she can do
this for any number that&#8217;s convenient for her!) As we discussed last time, this problem is thought
to be fundamentally intractable for large moduli, so this method is a bust: to do this requires
exponentially more computing power than the people sending messages, at least with current&nbsp;knowledge.
</p>

<p>
Another approach is to factor \(n\). It might be unclear how this would help: we&#8217;ll get to that in a
second. This approach is the most direct: if you need a one-sentence version of why breaking RSA is
hard, you should probably go with &#8220;integer factorization is&nbsp;hard&#8221;.
</p>

<p>
The last approach would be some other trick that avoids having to solve the integer factorization
problem or the discrete logarithm problem. This is a very important thing to keep in mind! The RSA
problem, as much as people often mix this up, is <i>not</i> proven to be equivalent to integer
factorization or computing discrete logarithms. In fact, it&#8217;s very reasonable to think that solving
either of those, which allows you to decrypt any message, should be harder than decrypting a single
message. As of yet no efficient way of breaking RSA like this is known, but it&#8217;s not impossible&nbsp;either. 
</p>

<p>
OK, so why does factoring \(n\) help? To see that, let&#8217;s go over how \(e\) and \(d\) are&nbsp;generated.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1546f9e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1546f9e">Generating&nbsp;Keys</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1546f9e">
<p>
So how did Alice find \(d\), if doing it seems so difficult? \(n\), \(e\) and \(d\) have to be generated
together: the whole point is that finding \(d\) if you only know \(n\) and \(e\) is really hard. We can
think of this as two&nbsp;sub-problems:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First, we find a number \(x\) such that \(a^x \equiv 1 \pmod n\) for all \(a\) coprime to \(n\), for
whichever \(n\) we end up&nbsp;picking.</li>
<li>Then, we find two numbers \(e\) and \(d\) such that \(ed \equiv 1 \pmod&nbsp;x\).</li>
</ul>
<p>
If we can do this, then we have, for any message&nbsp;\(m\),
</p>

<p>
\[(m^e)^d \equiv m^{ed} \equiv m^{kx + 1} \equiv (m^x)^k \times m \equiv 1^k \times m \equiv m \pmod&nbsp;n\]
</p>

<p>
which is the solution to the RSA problem that we&#8217;re looking for. Note that \(k\) is any positive
integer, and we know that we can find a \(k\) such that \(ed = kx + 1\) because \(ed \equiv 1 \pmod&nbsp;x\).
</p>

<p>
So how can we find some number \(x\) such that \(a^x \equiv 1 \pmod n\) for any \(a\) coprime to&nbsp;\(n\)? 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org93db6f0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org93db6f0">The Carmichael&nbsp;Function</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org93db6f0">
<p>
The function that takes in \(n\) and finds us the smallest \(x\) this works for is called the <i>Carmichael</i>
<i>function</i>. It&#8217;s usually written as&nbsp;\(\lambda(n)\).
</p>

<p>
Remember how last time we talked about <i>primitive roots</i>, numbers that generated every possible
exponent in their table of powers modulo some number \(n\)? Imagine \(n\) is prime for a second. In this
case, for any primitive root \(r\), we&#8217;ll first have \(r^x \equiv 1 \pmod n\) when \(x = n - 1\): it&#8217;ll go
through every number except \(0\), and then loop around. This means that the last number in the series
has to be \(1\), which is what we&#8217;re looking for. Thus, for any prime \(p\), \(\lambda(p) = p -&nbsp;1\).
</p>

<p>
Now let&#8217;s think about some \(n = pq\) that&#8217;s a semiprime. Let&#8217;s say we have a number \(x\) such that,
for a primitive root \(r\) of \(n\) (i.e., a number that takes the longest possible time to loop back
around to \(1\) without completely skipping it), \(r^x \equiv 1 \pmod n\). Because \(n = pq\), this means
that \(r^x \equiv 1 \pmod p\) and \(r^x \equiv 1 \pmod q\). (Think about why this is true!) We just solved
this problem for prime numbers: the first equation means \(x \equiv 0 \pmod{\lambda(p)}\) (that&#8217;s the definition
of \(\lambda\), after all), and the second means \(x \equiv 0 \pmod{\lambda(q)}\). \(\lambda(p) = p - 1\) and \(\lambda(q) = q -
1\). We&#8217;re looking for the first number that both \(p - 1\) and \(q - 1\) evenly divide. This is called
the <i>least common multiple</i>, or \(lcm\). Thus, for any semiprime \(n = pq\), \(\lambda(n) = lcm(p - 1, q -&nbsp;1)\).
</p>

<span class="marginnote"><p>
</p>
<p>
The language of group theory provides a very beautiful way of expressing what the Carmichael
function does, but I&#8217;m trying to keep this accessible for people without a lot of mathematical
background so I&#8217;ll skip talking about that for&nbsp;now.
</p>
</span>

<p>
That was a fair bit of math! It&#8217;s important to know <i>why</i> this last expression lets us generate keys,
and some introductions to RSA skip going over why the Carmichael function works out to this value
for semiprimes. That leaves a bad taste in my mouth: I hate explanations of anything that require
magic. Go get coffee or something and come back and look over this again if it helps: getting a feel
for why this works is vital to understanding how RSA actually uses integer factorization to make
hard problems. Hopefully, you now understand why computing \(lcm(p - 1, q - 1)\) is useful: it&#8217;s the
number that will let us generate \(e\) and&nbsp;\(d\).
</p>

<p>
Note that this process only works if we know \(p\) and \(q\)! This is why factoring \(n\) is one way of
breaking RSA: if we know \(p\) and \(q\), we can easily generate&nbsp;\(d\).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf1876c1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf1876c1">Finding \(e\) and&nbsp;\(d\)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf1876c1">
<p>
So now we have some number \(\lambda(n)\) such that, for any positive integer \(k\), raising a number to the
power \(k\lambda(n) + 1\) modulo \(n\) gets you your original number back. Now we just need to find two
numbers \(e\) and \(d\) that multiply to one of these numbers. This is essentially solving \(ed \equiv 1 \pmod
\lambda(n)\). For any specific \(e\), we can quickly find \(d\) using the <i>extended Euclidean algorithm</i>. I&#8217;m not
going to go into that too deeply right now, because this will already be a long post: check the
<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Modular_multiplicative_inverse#/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm">Wikipedia link</a> explaining it if you&#8217;re interested. I&#8217;m just going to keep going forward assuming
this algorithm works and is&nbsp;fast.
</p>


<span class="marginnote"><p>
</p>
<p>
The optimal way to do modular exponentation is actually based in the binary representation of the
exponent. Imagine we&#8217;re trying to raise a number \(n\) to some power \(e\) where \(e_2 = 10011\) in
binary. We can do this repeated squaring trick to find \(n^1, n^2, n^4\), and so on. We can essentially
think of the binary representation of \(e\) as saying that \(e = 2^4 + 2^1 + 2^0\), and so \(n^e = n^4 \times
n^1 \times n^0\). This means we have to do \(\log_2 e\) multiplications to generate all of the base
numbers, and then we need to do one multiplcation for every \(1\) in the binary representation of
\(e\). The number of $1$s in the binary representation of a number is called its <i>Hamming weight</i>: this
is a long-winded way of saying that the easiest numbers to exponentiate by are those with a small
Hamming&nbsp;weight.
</p>
</span>

<p>
This gives us a lot of choices: we can actually pick \(e\) or \(d\) to be whatever we want! In practice,
because you&#8217;re going to be encrypting messages by raising them to power \(e\), we want \(e\) to amenable
to the squaring trick we did earlier: finding \(m^{17}\) can be done with five multiplcations by repeated
squaring by doing \(((((m^2)^2)^2)^2) \times m\), but computing \(m^{15}\) isn&#8217;t as easy. The encryption is usually
about as secure regardless of the \(e\) you pick, and so it&#8217;s common to pick \(e = 2^{16} + 1 = 65537\) or
\(e = 3\) or whatever else. (Alternatively, to make decryption easier, you could pick \(d\) specially to
make decryption faster: this has the unfortunate side effect that it&#8217;s easier to guess \(d\),&nbsp;however.)

Let&#8217;s do another example, with slightly bigger numbers. The twist is that now I&#8217;m the one generating
a private key and Alice is the one sending a message. This will require all of the insight we&#8217;ve
gained so&nbsp;far!
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>First, I&#8217;ll generate two prime numbers: they should be roughly the same size and randomly
generated, so factoring their product is as hard as possible. I&#8217;ll pick \(p = 241\) and \(q =
   193\). Their product is \(n = pq = 46513\). In binary, this number is 16 digits long, so I have a
<i>16-bit key</i>. (In the real world, I&#8217;d use a 1024-bit or 2048-bit number, which is quite a bit&nbsp;bigger!)</li>
<li>Because I know \(p\) and \(q\), I can efficiently compute \(\lambda(n) = lcm(p - 1, q - 1) =&nbsp;960\).</li>
<li>Now I can pick \(e\). I&#8217;ll use \(e = 17\), which is easy for other people to encrypt&nbsp;with.</li>
<li>To find \(d\), I use the extended Euclidean algorithm to learn that \(17 \times 113 \equiv 1921 \equiv 1
   \pmod{960}\), so \(d = 113\). I keep this&nbsp;secret.</li>
<li>Now I send my public key to Alice: this is the pair \((n, e)\), so I send her \((46513,&nbsp;17)\).</li>
<li>Let&#8217;s say Alice wants to send the number \(314\) to me. She computes \(314^{17} \pmod{46513} \equiv 15319\)
and sends that number to&nbsp;me.</li>
<li>Now, only I know \(d\), and so only I can compute \(15319^{113} \equiv 314 \pmod{46513}\). Thus, only
Alice and I know what message she sent, and even someone who has listened to all of our
communications would be unable to figure this&nbsp;out.</li>

large couldn&#8217;t do until 1977 at the very least. Again, this is a criminally underappreciated
discovery, as important to the modern world as wireless Internet. The modern world simply could not
function without the service RSA&nbsp;provides.

<p>
Cryptography is about more than just sending secure messages, and there are other types of attackers
than simple eavesdroppers. Next time, we&#8217;ll look at a solution to different problems, like <i>identity
verification</i> and <i>message authenticity</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Alice and Bob are organizing anti-government activism in a country that represses political
freedoms. Alice wants to tell Bob to meet her in a certain place, but they can only communicate over
the Internet: Bob worries that the government, which controls their Internet provider, will forge a
message from Alice and set him up. They have shared RSA public keys with each other, but because
anyone can encrypt a message in RSA Bob can&#8217;t be sure that the messages he receives aren&#8217;t being
forged. How can Bob verify that Alice&#8217;s messages haven&#8217;t been&nbsp;modified?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This pops up in a much more mundane context as well: <i>password verification</i>. How can you show that
you are who you say you are, but without letting anyone else forge your identity? (Note that just
telling someone your password doesn&#8217;t work, because then they could impersonate you in the future.)
The solution to this problem, as it appears in the modern world, requires a new tool in our toolbox:
<i>cryptographic hash functions</i>. That&#8217;ll be next time. See you&nbsp;then!
