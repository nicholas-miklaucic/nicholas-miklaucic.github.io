<i>This is the second in my series on problem-solving techniques: for the first, see <a href="https://nicholas-miklaucic.github.io/posts/problem-solving-techniques-invariants/">this post on&nbsp;invariants.</a></i>
</p>

<p>
As I&#8217;ve previously discussed, I&#8217;m fascinated by the ability to create proofs or solutions for
problems that are easy to understand but difficult to synthesize. In this series, I&#8217;m trying to shed
some limited insight on how we mere mortals can arrive at these beautiful and creative&nbsp;insights.
</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>
Take the case of the structure of benzene. Chemists had been struggling to come up with a viable
structure for \(C_6H_6\): the experimental results for the compound seemed to contradict their available
theories. The scientist Friedrich August Kekulé finally theorized the correct solution problem by
realizing that benzene was a ring structure, with the hydrogens on the outside and the carbons in a
hexagonal configuration on the inside. (The actual work of proving this was done by Kathleen
Londsdale in&nbsp;1929.)
</p>

<span class="margin-note">
<p>
This story is a little dubious, and it certainly obscures the important study of resonance that
actually makes the benzene structure work. (I&#8217;m not including an image of the actual structure
because it isn&#8217;t quite what Kekulé thought it was, for example.) But it&#8217;s a really nice story,
wouldn&#8217;t you&nbsp;agree?
</p>
</span>

<p>
Kekulé described the process by which he first realized benzene&#8217;s structure 25 years later. As the
story goes, he fell asleep while thinking on the problem and had a vivid dream of the <i>ouroboros</i>: a
snake eating its own tail. After waking, he realized that this <i>ouroboros</i> described the structure of
benzene: a cycle. This structure, once you think to theorize it, instantly explains most of the
issues that had confounded prior attempts to find the solution to the benzene&nbsp;problem.
</p>

<p>
The reason I&#8217;m talking about Kekulé is that our goal is to arrive at these kinds of solutions
without metaphorical epiphanies from our subconscious. So, with this very long prologue out of the
way, how does induction help us solve&nbsp;problems?
</p>

<p>
Let&#8217;s introduce the concept with an example&nbsp;problem.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org0b8441c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0b8441c">The Blue-Eyed&nbsp;Islanders</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0b8441c">
<p>
Here&#8217;s our example logic&nbsp;problem:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
200 people live on an island. All of them are perfect logicians: they instantly make any logically
valid deduction the instant it is possible to do so. None of them know their own eye color: there
are no mirrors or reflective surfaces, and it is forbidden to talk about eye color. They do know
that only two eye colors exist on the island: blue, and green. In actuality, there are 100 blue-eyed
and 100 green-eyed people on the island. Every islander sees the eye color of everyone else on the
island. Each islander thus sees 99 people with their eye color and 100 people with the other eye
color, but they can&#8217;t use this information to determine their own eye color because they don&#8217;t know
the total numbers. Each day, a bus passes through the island, and anyone who knows their own eye
color leaves. The residents of the island know exactly who leaves and when. They also know all of
these&nbsp;rules.
</p>

<p>
One day, as part of an ancient ritual, a wise man comes onto the island and is allowed to say one
thing to the islanders. He pauses, and then says the following: &#8220;I see someone with blue&nbsp;eyes.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
What can the islanders deduce from this? Who figures out their eye color and leaves, and&nbsp;when?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I&#8217;d encourage you to try and solve it on your own, of course. There&#8217;s no trickery: if you&#8217;re unsure
of something, assume whatever makes the problem more interesting. (And the solution is not that
nothing&nbsp;happens!)
</p>

<p>
This problem, at least to me, seems really hard. We&#8217;ll see, however, that there is a structured way
of approaching this problem that doesn&#8217;t require anything of your&nbsp;subconscious!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7a34ef8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7a34ef8">The Principle of Mathematical&nbsp;Induction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7a34ef8">
<p>
This is one of the fancier sounding concepts in math, but it&#8217;s very simple. It&#8217;s essentially the
following logical&nbsp;deduction:
</p>

<p>
Let&#8217;s say we have some statement \(X\) that&#8217;s dependent on a natural number \(n\).&nbsp;If:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(X\) is true for \(0\) (or sometimes&nbsp;\(1\))</li>
<li>If \(X\) holds for \(n - 1\), it holds for&nbsp;\(n\)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Then \(X\) holds for all natural&nbsp;numbers.
</p>

<p>
The analogy I am legally required to make involves a domino chain. Induction is basically saying
that if we knock over the first domino, and each domino knocks over the next one, then all of the
dominos get knocked&nbsp;over.
</p>

<p>
There are some more complicated forms of induction, but this version is more than enough to solve
a large amount of problems. I&#8217;ve presented it as a proof technique, but we can essentially think of
it in a problem-solving context as well: <i>when a problem depends on some large natural number \(N\),</i>
<i>find the smallest number \(N\) could be that doesn&#8217;t completely trivialize the problem, think about
that case, and then try to work upwards from&nbsp;there.</i>
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org4f76446" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4f76446">Solving the Blue-Eyed Islander&nbsp;Problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4f76446">
<p>
<span class="caps">OK</span>, so how can we apply this to solve our problem? It&#8217;s really hard to reason about 200 people at
once: let&#8217;s start with the smallest cases we can, try to establish a pattern, and go from&nbsp;there.
</p>

<p>
The problem requires at least one person to have blue eyes. So the absolute simplest case is a
single islander with blue eyes. This is pretty boring: the wise man says that they see someone with
blue eyes, and then the islander knows they have blue eyes and boards the next bus off the&nbsp;island.
</p>

<p>
Let&#8217;s try the next case: 2 people. Now we have two options: either both have blue eyes, or only one
does. The case with 1 blue and 1 green is closer to our original problem, so we&#8217;ll try it
first. Now, when they hear the wise man, the islander with blue eyes knows that they have blue eyes
because they see the other person has green eyes. Thus, nothing changes: they still board the first
bus&nbsp;home.
</p>

<p>
But now, we have a new complexity from 2 people that didn&#8217;t exist with one. On day 2, once the
blue-eyed islander leaves, the green-eyed islander realizes that they must have green eyes. After
all, if they had blue eyes, there&#8217;s no way the other islander would have known they had blue
eyes. Thus, on day 2, the green-eyed islander&nbsp;leaves.
</p>

<p>
One of the best things about induction is that it lets you reduce problems to previously solved
instances when you&#8217;re working through new versions of it, which greatly speeds up the process of
deduction. We can see that with the case where there are 2 blue-eyed islanders. Each of them can&#8217;t
leave the first day because they don&#8217;t know their own eye color. <b>However</b>, they make the same logical
deductions we just made: both of them, on the second day, realize that if they had green eyes the
other person would have already left the island. Thus, on the second day, <i>both</i> of them leave the&nbsp;island. 
</p>

<p>
You might already see how this will play out, but let&#8217;s try the case for \(n = 3\). First, imagine the
case with 1 blue-eyed person and 2 green-eyed people. Here, on day 1, the blue-eyed islander will
deduce their eye color and leave, and on day 2 both of the green-eyed islanders leave: they know
that the blue-eyed person could only have left if they saw only green eyes. If there are 2 blue-eyed
people, then nothing will happen on day 1. On day 2, both of the blue-eyed islanders will know that
they have blue eyes because otherwise the other blue-eyed person would have left on day 1, and so
both of them will leave on day 2. The green-eyed islander, after seeing this, will leave on
day 3. If all of them have blue eyes, then 2 days pass before anything happens. Then, because
nothing happened on day 2, all of them can infer that they have blue eyes, and so they all leave on
day&nbsp;3.
</p>

<p>
This logic continues to hold up until \(n = 200\). In our version of the problem, the solution goes
like this: for 99 days, nothing will happen, and then on day 100 all of the blue-eyed people will
leave. Seeing this, all of the green-eyed islanders will know that there were 100 blue-eyed people
in total, and so all of them will leave the next&nbsp;day.
</p>

<p>
There&#8217;s quite the elegance to this problem: figuring out what happens is very hard in the case
that&#8217;s far removed from what we can easily deduce, but there&#8217;s a clear pattern that lets us build up
our deductions until we get where we need to be. I hope it gives some indication of the usefulness
of induction as a&nbsp;technique.

<h2 id="org6cb5ed9">The Handy-Dandy Pollard&#8217;s Rho Guide to Using&nbsp;Induction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6cb5ed9">
<p>
Just like the post on invariants, I want to give a &#8220;meta-solution&#8221; archetype for problems that can
be applied when it&#8217;s useful to do so. This isn&#8217;t completely automatic, because of its generality,
but it&#8217;s useful enough to guide you in a direction that&#8217;s likely to provide insights instead of
waiting for a&nbsp;dream.
</p>

<p>
The first thing to know is when induction should be considered. Induction, in the form we&#8217;ve shown,
requires some natural number \(n\) in the problem, such that \(n\) itself doesn&#8217;t qualitatively change
the problem. (In the islander problem, each extra person with blue eyes simply adds another day that
they all wait.) This can sometimes be pretty sneaky, as we&#8217;ll see. Secondly, the problem needs to
have some sort of <i>recursive</i> structure: when we think of writing down a solution, we usually approach
this by trying to solve the subsequent problem in terms of the one we just solved, but when we&#8217;re
trying to figure out whether this is even worth trying we usually approach it by thinking &#8220;can this
problem be decomposed into sub-problems?&#8221; Sometimes you need more than the immediately-preceding
problem&#8217;s solution to get to the next one: that&#8217;s fine for induction! (It&#8217;s perfectly fine if you
need the preceding three cases to get to the next one, for&nbsp;example.)
</p>

<p>
Once you&#8217;re convinced it&#8217;s worth trying, here&#8217;s my advice for doing&nbsp;so:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Isolate the natural number \(n\) at the heart of the problem. Sometimes you have more than one
choice: often all of them will work, but try whichever one seems easiest to break the problem
down&nbsp;using.</li>
<li>Work on the simplest meaningful case. For most problems this is \(n = 0\) or \(n =&nbsp;1\).</li>
<li>Once you&#8217;ve done the first case, increase \(n\) by one and keep&nbsp;going.</li>
<li>Search for some way of reducing the problem to the one you just&nbsp;solved.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you either find a pattern or give&nbsp;up.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org319ba69" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org319ba69">A Harder&nbsp;Example</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org319ba69">
<p>
There&#8217;s a bit of a problem for me as I write this. Induction is far more straightforward to apply to
problems than the concept of invariance: it&#8217;s pretty paint-by-numbers. That means that harder
examples tend to really mean &#8220;way more tedious&#8221; and not &#8220;interesting to explain.&#8221; Things like
<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Planar_graph#/Euler's_formula">Euler&#8217;s formula for graphs</a> or <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pick%2527s_theorem">Pick&#8217;s theorem</a> are possible applications of induction proofs, but they
aren&#8217;t really <i>fun</i>, just long to do properly and with mathematical&nbsp;rigor. 
</p>

<p>
Basically, any time there are ways to prove something with induction and without it, the way without
tends to be cooler. (This is definitely true for Euler&#8217;s formula: I may show a neat proof of that
some other time.) It&#8217;s only for problems like our islander one where induction is the only method of
showing the solution that it tends to feel elegant to&nbsp;use.
</p>

<p>
The other problem that I often see when induction is taught in math classes is that it&#8217;s used to
prove completely nonobvious results! A lot of common summations, like the sum of the first \(n\)
natural numbers being \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\), aren&#8217;t obvious when you don&#8217;t know them but can easily be
proved through induction if you do. For example, the closed-form solution for the \(n\)<sup>th</sup> Fibonacci
number \(F_n\), <i>Binet&#8217;s formula</i>, looks like&nbsp;this:
</p>

<p>
\[F_n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left(\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n - \left(\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}
\right)^n&nbsp;\right)\]
</p>

<p>
Telling someone to prove this with induction is just sad and demoralizing: it reduces the math
student to a mere assistant who helps clean up the elegant work that other people did. The method by
which you can solve general recurrences like the Fibonacci sequence is very interesting, but
verifying the formula in a way that gives you absolutely no insight into <i>why</i> it&#8217;s true isn&#8217;t what
math is about, in my&nbsp;book.
</p>

<p>
I&#8217;m going to instead present a more complicated example of induction where it&#8217;s used to solve a
problem, not merely to write a&nbsp;proof. 
</p>

<span class="margin-note">
<p>
For examples of induction in proofs, check out a helpful list of problems by Alexandersson <a href="https://www.math.upenn.edu/~peal/files/Proof.by.Induction%5B2018%5D%5BEng%5D-ALEXANDERSSON.pdf">here.</a>
Most of these are pretty rote (you&#8217;ll see Binet&#8217;s formula, for example), but there are some clever
ones, including the problem I&#8217;ll be showing about tiling with&nbsp;L-shapes.
</p>
</span>

<p>
The example I&#8217;m going to use should be a little familiar to anyone who read my previous post on
invariants. <i>Is it possible to tile a \(2^n \times 2^n\) square with any one square removed using L-shaped
pieces?</i> (For the very elegant proof that this cannot be done with any 2 squares removed, see that
post. You&#8217;ll notice that the argument I present there doesn&#8217;t generalize to this case, so you&#8217;ll
have to figure it out on your&nbsp;own.)
</p>

<p>
I would highly encourage you to do this on your own if you&#8217;re trying to get better at solving
problems with induction. This is a little more challenging than our last problem, because our
natural number \(n\) is an exponent: every problem has four times as many squares as the previous
iteration! I&#8217;ll go over the solution under the next&nbsp;header.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga29e6d3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga29e6d3">A Tiling Problem That Can Be&nbsp;Done?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga29e6d3">
<p>
<span class="caps">OK</span>, so let&#8217;s apply our little recipe of induction to this problem.
The base case we&#8217;re going to use is \(n = 1\): \(n = 0\) sorta makes sense, but not really. A 2x2 square
with one square removed is just one of the L-shapes we&#8217;re tiling with, so it&#8217;s a very simple base&nbsp;case.
</p>

<p>
For 4x4 squares, we could try and find a tiling on our own for every possible choice of the square
to take away. But, instead, we&#8217;re going to try and base this on the previous case so we can save
some time. This is where the magic&nbsp;happens.
</p>

<p>
Imagine cutting the grid by halves both ways, to split it into 4 copies of the previous iteration: 4
2x2 squares. Note that only one of these will have a square removed for now: we know by our previous
case that whichever quadrant has that missing square can be tiled. Now we need to figure out how to
deal with the other copies, all of which don&#8217;t have a missing square—yet. We can add a single
L-shape in the very center such that it has one square in each of these three remaining
quadrants. This removes one square from each of them, and so because the previous iteration was
solved we know that each of the remaining quadrants can be tiled. Thus, the 4x4 square with one
removed can be tiled with L-shaped&nbsp;pieces. 
</p>

<p>
Of course, there&#8217;s nothing about this logic that doesn&#8217;t hold for the 8x8 case, the 16x16 case, and
so on. Thus, by induction, we&#8217;ve shown that any \(2^n \times 2^n\) square can be tiled with L-shaped&nbsp;pieces.
</p>

<p>
Note that there&#8217;s something wonderfully constructive about this approach: we don&#8217;t just show that a
tiling is possible, we show exactly how to do it. This is a strength of induction as a method: it
tends to really show the relationships between subproblems, which often is very useful for
constructing&nbsp;solutions.

Just like last time, I&#8217;ll try and very quickly go through some other common uses of induction in
as many diverse fields as I can. This won&#8217;t be nearly as varied as the previous version of this for
invariants, because that concept is far more general, but it&#8217;ll still, I hope, provide a good sense
of when induction might be applicable to a&nbsp;problem.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org48448fd">
<p>
Any series with some closed-form sum over the natural numbers or some closed-form solution for a
recursive function can usually be proven with induction, although as I griped earlier it&#8217;s not so
easy to use induction to solve these series. However, if you notice a pattern, you can often use
induction to prove it rigorously. Some common examples are the sums of squares, \(\sum_{i=1}^n i^2 =
\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\), Binet&#8217;s formula which I showed above, and various combinatorics&nbsp;problems.

<p>
<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Graph_theory">Graph theory</a> is a natural fit for induction: the number of vertices in a graph, the number of edges,
and lots of other properties are all natural numbers. Induction on any one of these can be used to
prove all sorts of theorems about graphs: you show that it holds for the base case and that it
doesn&#8217;t change when you add a vertex or an edge. Examples are Euler&#8217;s formula, which I discussed
earlier, or coloring&nbsp;theorems.

<h3 id="org92a762e">Number&nbsp;Theory</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org92a762e">
<p>
Number theory is usually slightly harder to make work with induction, because things like prime
factorization change in incredibly complex ways when you add 1. But <i>strong induction</i>, where you
don&#8217;t go back by 1 every step, is very useful. For example, proving that any number has a unique
prime factorization can be done using&nbsp;induction.

That&#8217;s it for this post: I hope this helps any of you solving problems creatively using this
technique. Stay tuned for&nbsp;more!
