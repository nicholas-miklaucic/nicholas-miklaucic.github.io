*** A Poison Tree, by William Blake

#+BEGIN_VERSE
I was angry with my friend.
I told my wrath; my wrath did end.
I was angry with my foe.
I told it not; my wrath did grow.

And I watered it in fears,
Night & morning with my tears.
And I sunned it with smiles,
And with soft deceitful wiles.

And it grew both day and night.
Till it bore an apple bright.
And my foe beheld it shine,
And he knew that it was mine.

And into my garden stole,
When the night had veiled the pole,
In the morning glad I see;
My foe outstretched beneath the tree.
#+END_VERSE


Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a
theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.  This world in
arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its
scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick
school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000
population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete
pavement. We pay for a single fighter with a half-million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single
destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people...This is not a way of life
at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross
of iron. (April 16, 1953, Washington D.C.)
