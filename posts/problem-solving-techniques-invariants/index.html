There are a lot of clever proofs in mathematics and computer science. I&#8217;ve already talked about some
of them, and I hope to do a lot more of it on this blog. There&#8217;s often a certain separation that I
feel when I read something particularly creative or beautiful: this is amazing, but how could I ever
hope to produce something like it? Is real aesthetic achievement in these fields limited to those
with a natural talent I&nbsp;lack? 
</p>

<p>
I&#8217;m still not sure about that last question, but I do know that, like anything, it is possible to
improve at creative problem-solving through practice. The people I&#8217;ve known who have been best at
doing creative math—the kind that makes perfect sense when you see it but seems impossible to find
if you don&#8217;t already know it—have built up vast toolboxes of concepts and ideas that are useful in
many different ways across mathematics and computer science. These aren&#8217;t solutions for a single
problem: they&#8217;re meta-solutions that serve as an archetype for solutions to a diverse array of
problems. In my experience, the size of that toolbox is what, more than anything else, determines
how effectively one can find creative, novel ways of approaching problems. I&#8217;ll be talking about one
such tool today:&nbsp;invariants.

<h2 id="orgdcdffd8">What is an&nbsp;Invariant?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdcdffd8">
<span class="margin-note">
<p>
Angle, length, and volume are also all invariant under translation, reflection, and rotation. In
fact, we might define <i>geometry</i>, at least the kind taught in high school, as the study of properties
invariant under these&nbsp;operations.
</p>
</span>

<p>
An <i>invariant</i> is a property of something—any mathematical object or system you can think of—that
doesn&#8217;t change under some type of transformation. A really simple example is that the area of a
shape is invariant under translation, rotation, or&nbsp;reflection. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbd249e3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgbd249e3">Why Do We&nbsp;Care?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbd249e3">
<p>
The idea that area is invariant under these types of transformations is probably something you
already knew. Thinking about it like this, though, lets us easily use it in ways that aren&#8217;t
entirely obvious&nbsp;otherwise.
</p>

<p>
Take, for example, the problem of determining if two triangles are congruent: that is, if one can be
mapped onto the other through transformation, rotation, and reflection. In high school geometry you
learn that three sides determine a triangle, called <i><span class="caps">SSS</span> congruence</i>, and also that two sides and the
angle between then does the same thing, called <i><span class="caps">SAS</span> congruence</i>. If the three side lengths or two side
lengths and the angle between them match between two triangles, then we know that they can be mapped
to one another. You also might learn that two sides and an angle not between both of them does not
establish congruence. This isn&#8217;t intuitively obvious to many, and spurious &#8220;<span class="caps">SSA</span> congruence&#8221; is the
source of a lot of confusion in geometry&nbsp;classes.
</p>

<p>
One way you might intuit that this doesn&#8217;t work is that <span class="caps">SSS</span> and <span class="caps">SAS</span> come with associated formulae
for the area of their corresponding triangle: because area is invariant under any transformation
between congruent triangles, we know that congruence implies equal area. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heron%2527s_formula">Heron&#8217;s formula</a> gives you
the area of a triangle given its side lengths, and given two side lengths \(a\) and \(b\) and the angle
\(\theta\) between them the area of the resulting triangle is \(\frac{1}{2} ab \sin \theta\). No such formula
exists for another angle in the triangle, because two triangles with that configuration may have
different&nbsp;areas. 
</p>

<p>
I&#8217;m interested in the fact that <b>knowing these formulae can suggest a completely different</b>
<b>conjecture about congruence.</b> Knowing that <span class="caps">SSS</span> and <span class="caps">SAS</span> define a triangle&#8217;s <i>area</i> can suggest a
completely different result about transforming triangles into one&nbsp;another.
</p>

<p>
You might reasonably think that this sort of idea isn&#8217;t really that noteworthy or interesting, and
you hardly need to think about area as an invariant to come up with <span class="caps">SSS</span> or <span class="caps">SAS</span> congruence. I would
argue, however, that this jump is only underwhelming because the results it gives us are familiar
already. Let&#8217;s see how this sort of thinking can be applied to problems with less clear&nbsp;solutions.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org888c141" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org888c141">General&nbsp;Terminology</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org888c141">
<span class="margin-note">
<p>
Note that math has a lot of names for congruence, because we often want to talk about
several kinds of transformations for the same object, and so it&#8217;s a bit of a pain to keep track
of. Graphs are <i>isomorphic</i>, triangles and integers are <i>congruent</i>, other objects are <i>equivalent</i>,
etc. This concept is incredibly general, and disciplines like category theory provide a really
abstract foundation for these types of relations, but I&#8217;m not going there for this&nbsp;post.
</p>
</span>

<p>
Because we&#8217;re going to step outside the realm of synthetic geometry, I want to introduce some
terminology that&#8217;s not tied to triangles. Let&#8217;s call any sequence of transformations that fit our
criteria (above, that was any sequence of translation, reflection, and rotation) a <i>map</i>. We say two
objects are <i>congruent</i> if they have the same value for an invariant. Note that congruence behaves
like equality (it&#8217;s reflexive, commutative, and transitive). Thus, we call a class of objects that
all have some specific value for an invariant an <i>equivalence class</i>. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5b177ca" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5b177ca">A Cooler&nbsp;Example</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5b177ca">
<p>
Imagine we have a grid and we can place 1x2 dominoes in that grid. There are all sorts of shapes we
can make by placing these dominoes in different ways: we could make a 2x2 square, a 1x4 line, most
of the Tetris pieces, you get the idea. There are also some shapes we can&#8217;t make: a 1x1 square, for
example, obviously can&#8217;t be made by placing dominoes like&nbsp;this.
</p>

<p>
Imagine the shape created by an 8x8 square where two diagonally-opposite corners are removed. I&#8217;ll
call it the <i>mutilated square.</i> Here&#8217;s the problem: can we make this shape by tiling&nbsp;dominoes?
</p>

<p>
I highly encourage you to try doing this yourself. You might find it easier to start with smaller
shapes: a 4x4 square with the same removed corners, a 3x4 rectangle, you name&nbsp;it. 
</p>

<p>
You should (hopefully!) find that tiling the 8x8 mutilated square isn&#8217;t easy. You might conjecture
that it&#8217;s impossible once you&#8217;ve tried it. The question is: how could we go about proving that this
tiling is truly impossible and not just difficult to&nbsp;find?
</p>

<p>
I have no doubt there exists a laborious, tedious proof of this that basically starts with smaller
shapes and grows up from there, with lots of casework about how you place your starting domino and
the resulting shape. This is about creative, cool proofs, however, and you might infer from the
fact that I&#8217;m talking about this that we can use an invariant to solve this&nbsp;elegantly.
</p>

<p>
Why might we think to try using an invariant (the problems you have elsewhere probably won&#8217;t have
&#8220;Invariants&#8221; in the website title!) when there are so many possible options for a proof, some of
which are probably successful if inelegant? Knowing how to recognize problems that invariants might
be fruitfully applied to is as important as knowing how to use&nbsp;invariants.
</p>

<p>
In this case, we&#8217;re trying to show that a certain kind of map—repeatedly adding or removing a 1x2
domino adjoining the current shape—can&#8217;t transform one object, the empty shape with no dominoes
placed, into another, the 8x8 mutilated square. Showing that no such map exists is not an easy task,
because there are a lot of possible sequences and it&#8217;s hard to reason about the whole space of every
possible attempt to tile the mutilated&nbsp;square.
</p>

<p>
Enter invariants: problems about objects under transformations are usually an extremely good fit for
this tool. Now we know to try this method. The question is, how do we apply this&nbsp;technique?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org68c434b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org68c434b">The Handy-Dandy Pollard&#8217;s Rho Guide to Using&nbsp;Invariants</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org68c434b">
<p>
I&#8217;m going to break this up into a couple of distinct&nbsp;steps.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Clearly define the underlying transformation and mathematical objects that the problem uses. The
problem should be of the form &#8220;does there exist a map that maps X to Y?&#8221; (That is, are X and Y&nbsp;equivalent?)</li>
<li>Identify possible invariants under this&nbsp;transformation.</li>
<li>Check your invariants to see if any of them differ between the start and target&nbsp;objects.</li>
<li>If any invariants differ, then simply showing that combined with proving the invariance of the
property you&#8217;re using completes the proof that no such transformation sequence&nbsp;exists.</li>
<li>If none of the invariants differ but you&#8217;re convinced the transformation really is impossible,
then go back to step&nbsp;2.</li>
<li>If none of the invariants differ and you&#8217;re not convinced the transformation is impossible, try
to find such a transformation. Your invariants can still be helpful: think of simple base cases
that match the invariants and try to find a way to map an arbitrary object to that base
case. Because most of these transformations are reversible, this allows you to interconvert
between any two arbitrary objects X and Y: transform X into the base, and transform the base into&nbsp;Y.</li>
</ol>
<p>
We&#8217;ve already done the first step: our object is &#8220;shapes made through tiling dominoes on a grid&#8221;,
and our transformation is &#8220;adding or removing dominoes.&#8221; Let&#8217;s move on to step 2. What properties
does this transformation preserve? If you&#8217;re following along, try to do this yourself. Here&#8217;s the
first one I thought of: the parity (&#8220;evenness&#8221;) of the shape&#8217;s area. The dominoes have even area,
and so adding them can&#8217;t make a shape with odd area have even area or vice versa. Parity is the most
common form of invariant in lots of discrete problems, and so it&#8217;s a good starting&nbsp;choice.
</p>

<p>
On to step 3. Can area parity solve our problem? Sadly, the answer is no: the 8x8 mutilated square
has area 62, and the empty shape has area 0, both of which have the same area parity. (This would
work if our starting shape was a single 1x1 square, for example, but that&#8217;s not this&nbsp;problem.)
</p>

<p>
You might continue trying to tile the mutilated square: perhaps there really is a way to do
it. (These decisions are what separates a meta-solution from a solution: this is an archetype for
solutions, but it&#8217;s not completely formulaic to apply.) It really isn&#8217;t possible, though, so you&#8217;re
probably not going to get very&nbsp;far.
</p>

<p>
I liked the parity idea, though: is there some way of using parity in a different way? As it turns
out, there&nbsp;is!
</p>

<span class="margin-note">
<p>
If you want a more rigorous definition of parity, something like this will do. <i>Parity</i> is some way of
assigning &#8220;even&#8221; and &#8220;odd&#8221; to objects that can be combined in some way such that combining two even
objects results in an even object, combining two odd objects results in an even object, and
combining an even and odd object results in an odd&nbsp;object.
</p>
</span>

<p>
I have some fessing up to do. I&#8217;ve been a little coy with my terminology: this problem is usually
framed as the <i>mutilated</i> <i>chessboard problem.</i> Chessboards have an interesting variant of parity:
they&#8217;re alternately colored black and white. It may seem like a stretch to call this parity, but it
really isn&#8217;t. We could imagine assigning each square a coordinate, where \((0, 0)\) is the bottom left
and \((1, 0)\) is the square to the right of that. A normal chessboard is colored so that any square
at coordinate \((x, y)\) is black if \(x + y\) is even and white if \(x + y\) is odd: a square&#8217;s color
reflects its&nbsp;parity.
</p>

<p>
Note that a domino always covers one even square and one odd square. Thus, the difference between
the number of even and odd squares in a shape is an invariant under our transformation! I&#8217;m going to
call this difference the <i>parity balance.</i> Parity balance works perfectly for our problem: the normal
8x8 chessboard had the same number of white and black squares, but on a chessboard the opposing
diagonal corners are the same color. We removed two of them, so the resulting shape has a net
imbalance: it has two more black squares than white squares. Our starting empty shape has no such
imbalance, and so there&#8217;s no way to create the mutilated chessboard under our&nbsp;invariant.
</p>

<p>
Note that formalizing this into a proof isn&#8217;t quite done, but we have the essential creative insight
that&#8217;s needed to solve the problem. The rest is just formally proving that our domino tiling can&#8217;t
change the balance of black and white squares and showing that the invariant really is different
between the&nbsp;shapes.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4c1d703" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org4c1d703">Generalization</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4c1d703">
<p>
Using invariance is especially fruitful because it suggests a number of other very interesting
questions. Specifically, we know that our two invariants are <i>necessary</i> for a map to exist between
two shapes X and Y. In math, once you&#8217;ve shown that something is necessary, it&#8217;s often fruitful to
then ask if it&#8217;s <i>sufficient</i>: that any object X can be mapped to any object Y in its equivalence&nbsp;class. 
</p>

<p>
Sadly, the answer to this question is no: a counterexample is that a T-shape like the one in Tetris
satisfies both of our invariants but can&#8217;t be tiled with&nbsp;dominoes.
</p>

<p>
You might reasonably ask if there is some invariant that is both necessary and sufficient for this
transformation. This is an excellent question! The answer is yes, but it&#8217;s substantially more
complicated than what I could reasonably introduce here.<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2324578"> This paper</a> (cited in the margin)
establishes such an invariant and shows an approach that can work for other types of&nbsp;tiling.

Now that we&#8217;ve developed one example in full, I want to quickly run through a bunch of other
problems where invariants are useful as a way to aid the reader in recognizing possible invariants
in other problems. I&#8217;m not going to go in-depth on any of them, but I&#8217;ll provide links for the
interested reader to learn&nbsp;more.

<h3 id="org151692a">The 15&nbsp;puzzle</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org151692a">
<p>
There&#8217;s a famous sliding block <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle">puzzle</a> that starts with a 4x4 grid tiled with numbers, with the last
16 tile missing. The task is to switch the 14 and 15 tiles. There&#8217;s a parity invariant, a bit too
complicated to get into here, that shows that this puzzle is impossible in its standard form: this
didn&#8217;t stop Sam Loyd, famed puzzle author, from offering $1,000 for doing just&nbsp;that!

<p>
There&#8217;s another parity invariant here that applies to the standard Rubik&#8217;s cube: it&#8217;s impossible to
switch two adjacent edge pieces without doing anything else. (If you have any friends who solve
Rubik&#8217;s cubes, this is good for a laugh: dissassemble two edges and switch them, then shuffle the
whole thing and see how long it takes them to figure it out.) As it happens, this parity combined
with the orientation of the corners is sufficient for two cubes to be congruent: there are 12 such
equivalence classes, and so a cube randomly disassembled and put back together has only a 1 in 12
chance of being&nbsp;soluble.

Given two polygons, can you cut one into pieces and reassemble them to get the other? The invariant

necessary and sufficient for two shapes to be &#8220;scissors-congruent&#8221; (to distinguish it from normal
congruence of shapes), a fact proved by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace%25E2%2580%2593Bolyai%25E2%2580%2593Gerwien_theorem">Wallace-Bolyai-Gerwien theorem</a>.

Extending the Wallace-Bolyai-Gerwien theorem to polyhedra was a famous problem, included on David
Hilbert&#8217;s seminal list of problems presented in 1900 as important directions for future
mathematics. Can any two polyhedra with equal volume be transformed into each other by cutting and
rearranging pieces? This problem, the third on Hilbert&#8217;s list, was solved by Max Dehn that very same
year: no, it isn&#8217;t always possible. There&#8217;s a second invariant, called the <i>Dehn invariant</i>, that
involves the angles of different edges. Volume and the Dehn invariant together are sufficient to
show that two polyhedra can be dissected into each&nbsp;other.

All sorts of invariants occur in physics problems, depending on the exact transformations being
used: momentum, energy, the speed of light, etc. These are usually called <i>conservation laws</i>. Taking
your standard high-school mechanics and reformulating it in terms of invariants can produce some
very important theory, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics">Lagrangian mechanics</a>. There&#8217;s a very beautiful and deep result that
connects invariants to symmetries called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%2527s_theorem">Noether&#8217;s theorem</a>.

<p>
I earlier mentioned that you can think of geometry as the study of invariants under translation,
rotation, and reflection. What if we generalized this list to include any type of continuous
deformation, like stretching or twisting? This question results in a new discipline:
topology. Things like area and angle are no longer preserved, but the weaker invariants that still
hold are incredibly&nbsp;useful. 
</p>

<p>
For example, the number of holes in an object (playing <i>very</i> fast and loose) is invariant under these
deformations: you can turn a sphere into a cube because they&#8217;re both completely solid, but you can&#8217;t
transform either into a torus (a donut shape) without tearing them because the torus has a <i>genus</i>
(the formal term for this number of holes) of 1 whereas the sphere and cube have genus&nbsp;0.

<h3 id="org780d33e">Theorema&nbsp;Egregium</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org780d33e">
<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature?oldformat=true">theorema egregium</a> (&#8220;remarkable theorem&#8221;), proved by Gauss, loosely states that the curvature of
a 2D surface doesn&#8217;t change depending on how you bend it in 3D space. For example, you can&#8217;t bend an
orange peel until it&#8217;s perfectly flat without breaking it somewhere because the sphere has&nbsp;curvature.
</p>

<p>
This is one of my favorite results from this field because it&#8217;s so accessible and intuitive in its
practical applications. Imagine a piece of pizza. It&#8217;s easy to bend if you lay it flat, because
there are two degrees of freedom: the tip can curve down and the slice can remain flat (under the
definition of curvature that we&#8217;re using) because one of the axes (the one parallel to the crust) is
still flat. If we restrict this by curving the slice along the axis parallel to the crust, it
reduces the ability of the shape to curve in the other direction because it still has to be
flat. Or, put another way, folding pizza makes it more&nbsp;stable!

I have two hopes at this point: that you, the reader, are now a little better at solving math
problems creatively, and that you&#8217;ve seen how powerful invariants are in mathematics and for
understanding the world. There&#8217;s really no limit to how deep the rabbit hole&nbsp;goes.
</p>

<p>
The interested reader might be thinking about how you might reason about invariants and
transformations more generally than I have. That abstraction results in group theory, a fascinating
branch of math that I think more than repays some study for anyone interested in math, physics, or
computer science. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)?oldformat=true">Wikipedia article on what a group is</a> might be a good place to start if the
stuff I&#8217;ve talked about is new to you and you&#8217;d like to learn&nbsp;more.

<p>
Thanks for reading! Stay tuned for&nbsp;more.
