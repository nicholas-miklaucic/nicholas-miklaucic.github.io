Last year, I led the team behind &lt;a href="https://2019.pactf.com/"&gt;PACTF 2019&lt;/a&gt;, a CTF competition where people, mostly high schoolers,
solved problems based on computers and computer security. It was a really fun and rewarding
experience, and I think a lot of people hopefullly had fun solving the problems. If that sounds like
something you might like, I'd recommend trying it out: make an account and see what you can do! I
wrote about a dozen problems for this contest, and so you'll see some overlapping themes with what I
talk about on this blog.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Someone recently asked me to write up my explanation for one of the problems I wrote: "Denial of
Service Attack", one of the harder problems in the second week.  You're welcome to try the problem
on the PACTF website in full before we begin. I will be spoiling the whole thing here: you've been
warned! I'll start with a brief overview, give some background, and go over the main trick.
&lt;/p&gt;
