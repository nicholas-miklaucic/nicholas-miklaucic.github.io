&lt;i&gt;This is the second in my series on problem-solving techniques: for the first, see &lt;a href="https://nicholas-miklaucic.github.io/posts/problem-solving-techniques-invariants/"&gt;this post on invariants.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As I've previously discussed, I'm fascinated by the ability to create proofs or solutions for
problems that are easy to understand but difficult to synthesize. In this series, I'm trying to shed
some limited insight on how we mere mortals can arrive at these beautiful and creative insights.
&lt;/p&gt;

How can we send secure messages through insecure channels?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A quick note before we begin: this summarizes a talk I gave at my high school's computer science
club. It's written to be accessible to anyone with a basic math background, though, and it doesn't
require any programming knowledge. This is the start of a series that will try to explain the basics
of cryptography: given that all of us use cryptography every day, it's important to have a basic
understanding of how it works. It's also pretty cool!
&lt;/p&gt;

There are a lot of clever proofs in mathematics and computer science. I've already talked about some
of them, and I hope to do a lot more of it on this blog. There's often a certain separation that I
feel when I read something particularly creative or beautiful: this is amazing, but how could I ever
hope to produce something like it? Is real aesthetic achievement in these fields limited to those
with a natural talent I lack? 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm still not sure about that last question, but I do know that, like anything, it is possible to
improve at creative problem-solving through practice. The people I've known who have been best at
doing creative math—the kind that makes perfect sense when you see it but seems impossible to find
if you don't already know it—have built up vast toolboxes of concepts and ideas that are useful in
many different ways across mathematics and computer science. These aren't solutions for a single
problem: they're meta-solutions that serve as an archetype for solutions to a diverse array of
problems. In my experience, the size of that toolbox is what, more than anything else, determines
how effectively one can find creative, novel ways of approaching problems. I'll be talking about one
such tool today: invariants.
&lt;/p&gt;

This is the first public page for this blog: a place where I will record thoughts and essays on
various topics, usually pretty close to the intersection of math, data, and computing. There will be
some pretty heavy mathematical topics as well as much lighter fare: my hope is that people of varied
math and computer science backgrounds can find something useful for them.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So, hello world!&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="https://nicholas-miklaucic.github.io/posts/hello-world/#fn.1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I thought the first thing I should probably do is explain why I go by the tag
&lt;code&gt;PollardsRho&lt;/code&gt; in various places and why I decided to give this blog the title "Pollard's Rho." Simply
put, it's my favorite algorithm: kind of an esoteric category to have a favorite in, but I'm sure by
the end of this you'll see what I mean.
&lt;/p&gt;
