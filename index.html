We&#8217;re previously discussed cryptography, in the modern world, as a way of sending secure messages
through insecure channels. But this is not the only thing you might want to do in a world with
malicious actors trying to thwart you. RSA and Diffie-Hellman exchange aren&#8217;t vulnerable to simple
eavesdroppers. However, there are other types of attacks that they don&#8217;t protect against, and we
might want to insulate ourselves against those attacks as well. One of them is a <i>man-in-the-middle</i>
attack—in essence, someone manipulating messages. As we&#8217;ve often done, let&#8217;s imagine a scenario, the one
I ended the last post&nbsp;with:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Alice and Bob are organizing anti-government activism in a country that represses political
freedoms. Alice wants to tell Bob to meet her in a certain place, but they can only communicate over
the Internet: Bob worries that Malcolm, the government employee that controls their Internet
provider, will forge a message from Alice and set him up. How can Bob verify that Alice&#8217;s messages
haven&#8217;t been&nbsp;modified?

This is part 2 of a series: to see the first post, go <a href="https://nicholas-miklaucic.github.io/posts/the-basics-of-cryptography-part-1-diffie-hellman-key-exchange/">here.</a> If you&#8217;re not familiar with things like
modular arithmetic, read that before reading&nbsp;this.
</p>

<p>
Today we&#8217;re going to continue to look behind the curtain at the algorithms that power the Internet
we know and love. In this post, I&#8217;ll cover the RSA cryptosystem: what it is, what it does, how it
works, etc. RSA is such a useful algorithm because it sidesteps a lot of the problems with sending
secure messages we talked about last time. You can think of it as a clever way of improving on the
encryption model we used last time, not by simply improving it as it exists, but by completely
sidestepping the security problems it&nbsp;had.
</p>

<p>
This post will introduce a pristine version of RSA, without the real-world complications, and apply
it to the same problem we looked at last time: securely sending a message to someone else over an
insecure channel, without prior communication. In the future, I&#8217;ll look at how this textbook RSA
fails in the real world, and additionally how you can use the idea behind RSA to do things besides
sending secure&nbsp;messages.

As I&#8217;ve previously discussed, I&#8217;m fascinated by the ability to create proofs or solutions for
problems that are easy to understand but difficult to synthesize. In this series, I&#8217;m trying to shed
some limited insight on how we mere mortals can arrive at these beautiful and creative&nbsp;insights.

How can we send secure messages through insecure&nbsp;channels?
</p>

<p>
A quick note before we begin: this summarizes a talk I gave at my high school&#8217;s computer science
club. It&#8217;s written to be accessible to anyone with a basic math background, though, and it doesn&#8217;t
require any programming knowledge. This is the start of a series that will try to explain the basics
of cryptography: given that all of us use cryptography every day, it&#8217;s important to have a basic
understanding of how it works. It&#8217;s also pretty&nbsp;cool!

As I mentioned <a href="https://nicholas-miklaucic.github.io/posts/pactf-2019-writeup-denial-of-service-attack/">in this post</a>, I wrote several problems for PACTF 2019, a cybersecurity and
programming competition held for high schoolers. I&#8217;ve been asked to do writeups for each of the
problems I did, and so I&#8217;ll be trying to do that—at least, where I think there&#8217;s something
interesting to talk about for the people reading this who didn&#8217;t compete and don&#8217;t care about the&nbsp;contest. 
</p>

<p>
Today, we&#8217;ll be going over &#8220;How&#8217;d I Get Hacked?&#8221;, which gives me an opportunity to talk about one of
my favorite niche programming topics: the utter insanity and brilliance of&nbsp;Unicode.

There are a lot of clever proofs in mathematics and computer science. I&#8217;ve already talked about some
of them, and I hope to do a lot more of it on this blog. There&#8217;s often a certain separation that I
feel when I read something particularly creative or beautiful: this is amazing, but how could I ever
hope to produce something like it? Is real aesthetic achievement in these fields limited to those
with a natural talent I&nbsp;lack? 
</p>

<p>
I&#8217;m still not sure about that last question, but I do know that, like anything, it is possible to
improve at creative problem-solving through practice. The people I&#8217;ve known who have been best at
doing creative math—the kind that makes perfect sense when you see it but seems impossible to find
if you don&#8217;t already know it—have built up vast toolboxes of concepts and ideas that are useful in
many different ways across mathematics and computer science. These aren&#8217;t solutions for a single
problem: they&#8217;re meta-solutions that serve as an archetype for solutions to a diverse array of
problems. In my experience, the size of that toolbox is what, more than anything else, determines
how effectively one can find creative, novel ways of approaching problems. I&#8217;ll be talking about one
such tool today:&nbsp;invariants.

Last year, I led the team behind <a href="https://2019.pactf.com/">PACTF 2019</a>, a CTF competition where people, mostly high schoolers,
solved problems based on computers and computer security. It was a really fun and rewarding
experience, and I think a lot of people hopefullly had fun solving the problems. If that sounds like
something you might like, I&#8217;d recommend trying it out: make an account and see what you can do! I
wrote about a dozen problems for this contest, and so you&#8217;ll see some overlapping themes with what I
talk about on this&nbsp;blog.
</p>

<p>
Someone recently asked me to write up my explanation for one of the problems I wrote: &#8220;Denial of
Service Attack&#8221;, one of the harder problems in the second week.  You&#8217;re welcome to try the problem
on the PACTF website in full before we begin. I will be spoiling the whole thing here: you&#8217;ve been
warned! I&#8217;ll start with a brief overview, give some background, and go over the main&nbsp;trick.

Hello&nbsp;again! 
</p>

<p>
Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve been working on your dataviz skills, and you think you&#8217;ve found an interesting
pattern or correlation in a dataset. How can you tell that whatever you&#8217;re seeing is significant?
How can you distinguish between random variation and legitimate, meaningful results? As it happens,
the mathematical branch of statistics is almost entirely devoted to questions like these. I think
aspiring data scientists need not be full-fledged statisticians, but everyone should be familiar
with the basic statistical tests, when to apply them, and how to interpret their&nbsp;results.
</p>

<p>
Today we&#8217;ll be sojourning through the land of statistical tests in Python, showing how they might be
used and interpreted. The goal is not that you&#8217;ll be able to apply this all immediately when you
need it; instead, the goal is that you can recognize when statistical tests might be useful and be
able to find the ones you need. (In an age of the Internet, I find recognition to be much more
important than memorizing everything: if you know what to Google, you can figure out how to code it,
but you can&#8217;t Google something you can&#8217;t put into words or something you can&#8217;t&nbsp;recognize.)

Data visualization and data science is a hot topic right now, and there&#8217;s lots of people I know who
want to develop this skill set. A common hurdle, in my experience, is that a lot of tutorials are
either incredibly specific (here&#8217;s how to change the y-axis title) or very abstract (this is what a
violin plot is, good luck making one!) The goal of this tutorial is to make the kind of resource I
would have really benefited from when I was starting out: an introduction that can give you the
background you need to actually benefit from internal documentation and give you an idea of what&#8217;s
possible so you aren&#8217;t reinventing the wheel (an extraordinarily common problem). This post is
written&nbsp;for:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People who aren&#8217;t completely new to computer programming, but not necessarily programmers or software developers
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You need to know basic Python syntax to follow along, but you don&#8217;t need to actually know much about&nbsp;Python</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anyone who is tired of the limitations of programs like Tableau and wants to be able to make
bespoke visualizations that meet their specific&nbsp;needs</li>
<li>Those who are interested in using Python for statistics or machine learning who want some
wider background before they&nbsp;start</li>
<li>Students or presenters of any kind who want to make beautiful graphs without fighting Excel for
an&nbsp;hour</li>
</ul>
<p>
If any of these describe you, you&#8217;ve come to the right&nbsp;place!

In the last episode, we introduced two thinking errors that often come up in statistics: Bayes&#8217;
paradox and regression to the mean. I proposed that these errors are really two different
manifestations of the same underlying phenomenon, but I haven&#8217;t done much to actually explain
why. This post will lay the mathematical groundwork for that&nbsp;explanation!
