<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org583984e">
<p>
This series of posts is about how to make effective data visualization: exactly
what I mean by that will become clear shortly. Much like one might critique
writing in a creative writing class, I&#8217;ll focus on how to improve existing
visualizations. This should hopefully also help the reader become a better
consumer of data visualization they encounter in their daily&nbsp;lives.

<h3 id="org7b6ac65">Who This Guide Is&nbsp;For</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7b6ac65">
<p>
This guide is for anyone! Unlike my other work on this blog, this guide expects
no knowledge of coding or any platform for visualizations: learning such a tool
is necessary to implement these ideas, but not necessary for this guide at all.
My hope is that this is generally useful for people in business, data science,
journalism, programming, and statistics: anyone who works with or cares about&nbsp;data.
</p>

<p>
Without further ado, let&#8217;s get&nbsp;started!

<h2 id="orgac1be72">What is Effective Data&nbsp;Visualization?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgac1be72">
<p>
What do I mean by <i>effective</i> data visualization? Here, an effective data
visualization is one that effectively helps the viewer process information. I
care here about dataviz as a tool that increases our brains&#8217; ability to work
with&nbsp;data.
</p>

<p>
This is contrasted with purely aesthetic concerns. Some visuals that don&#8217;t look
spiffy are nonetheless useful tools, and some visuals that are aesthetically
unappealing are useful processing&nbsp;aids.
</p>

<p>
Data can be deadly serious, and so data visualization can have tremendous&nbsp;importance.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/teachback/ChristaMcAuliffe.jpg" alt="nil">
The <i>Challenger</i> disaster in which Christa McAuliffe, the person in the photo
above, died is a grim reminder of information&#8217;s power. The O-ring failure
that led to the explosion was preventable and understood. Thus, some authors
like Edward Tufte have analyzed this tragedy as a failure of data visualization
as much as anything else: the visualizations used to communicate the dire need
to reschedule the launch failed to convey this knowledge to the people who made
that fateful decision. This is to say that effectively communicating and
understanding data is worthy of serious&nbsp;study.
</p>

<p>
Why use data visualization at all? Why not use other tools, like spreadsheets or&nbsp;statistics?
</p>

<h2 id="org91a1834">Why is Effective Data&nbsp;Visualization?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org91a1834">
<p>
There&#8217;s a persistent myth that graphs are inherently less meaningful or useful
than raw statistics. Statistics are very important, and I would certainly not
advocate for replacing the statistics underlying, say, clinical trials with a
bunch of&nbsp;graphs.
</p>

<p>
The classic example of why we might use data visualization in addition to
statistics comes to use from Frank Anscombe in the form of 4 different datasets
like this&nbsp;one:
</p>

<table border="1" class="dataframe">
<thead><tr style="text-align: right;">
<th>x</th>
      <th>y</th>
    </tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>10.0</td>
      <td>8.04</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>8.0</td>
      <td>6.95</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>13.0</td>
      <td>7.58</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>9.0</td>
      <td>8.81</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>11.0</td>
      <td>8.33</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>14.0</td>
      <td>9.96</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>6.0</td>
      <td>7.24</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>4.0</td>
      <td>4.26</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>12.0</td>
      <td>10.84</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>7.0</td>
      <td>4.82</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
<td>5.0</td>
      <td>5.68</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
Imagine you&#8217;re trying to find out if y is related to x and figure out the nature
of that relationship. It&#8217;s rather difficult to parse this information,
especially given that this is just one-fourth of the total. Let&#8217;s try using some
exploratory statistics to get a better sense of the data: the mean of each
variable, the standard deviation of each variable, the regression line, the
Pearson correlation, and the \(R^2\)&nbsp;value.
</p>

<table border="1" class="dataframe">
<thead>
<tr style="text-align: right;">

      <th>\(\mu_x\)</th>
      <th>\(\mu_y\)</th>

      <td>0.667</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
The standard statistics we might use when we don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re looking for
yet aren&#8217;t distinguishing these datasets at all. Let&#8217;s see what a plot looks&nbsp;like:
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/teachback/anscombe.png" alt="nil"></p>

<p>
Sometimes a picture really is worth a thousand correlation&nbsp;values:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The first dataset seems like a fairly standard linear correlation with some
noise: linear regression seems like a good&nbsp;fit.</li>
<li>The second dataset has a very regular relationship, but it&#8217;s not linear!
Modeling this with a quadratic would work&nbsp;well.</li>
<li>The third dataset has a very regular relationship with one crazy&nbsp;outlier.</li>
<li>The fourth dataset is barely a dataset! Something has gone terribly wrong and
a single influential outlier is preventing us from seeing that in&nbsp;statistics.</li>
</ul>
<p>
There is no tool that is more effective at quickly sussing out these patterns
than a visualization like this&nbsp;one.
</p>

<p>
That&#8217;s all for today. Next time I&#8217;ll talk about visual complexity and visual
overload, and I&#8217;ll do my part to combat some pernicious misconceptions about how
sophisticated data visualization should be. See you&nbsp;then!

We&#8217;ve previously discussed cryptography, in the modern world, as a way of sending secure messages
through insecure channels. But this is not the only thing you might want to do in a world with
malicious actors trying to thwart you. <span class="caps">RSA</span> and Diffie-Hellman exchange aren&#8217;t vulnerable to simple
eavesdroppers. However, there are other types of attacks that they don&#8217;t protect against, and we
might want to insulate ourselves against those attacks as well. One of them is a <i>man-in-the-middle</i>
attack—in essence, someone manipulating messages. As we&#8217;ve often done, let&#8217;s imagine a scenario, the one
I ended the last post&nbsp;with:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Alice and Bob are organizing anti-government activism in a country that represses political
freedoms. Alice wants to tell Bob to meet her in a certain place, but they can only communicate over
the Internet: Bob worries that Malcolm, the government employee that controls their Internet
provider, will forge a message from Alice and set him up. How can Bob verify that Alice&#8217;s messages
haven&#8217;t been&nbsp;modified?

This is part 2 of a series: to see the first post, go <a href="https://nicholas-miklaucic.github.io/posts/the-basics-of-cryptography-part-1-diffie-hellman-key-exchange/">here.</a> If you&#8217;re not familiar with things like
modular arithmetic, read that before reading&nbsp;this.
</p>

<p>
Today we&#8217;re going to continue to look behind the curtain at the algorithms that power the Internet
we know and love. In this post, I&#8217;ll cover the <span class="caps">RSA</span> cryptosystem: what it is, what it does, how it
works, etc. <span class="caps">RSA</span> is such a useful algorithm because it sidesteps a lot of the problems with sending
secure messages we talked about last time. You can think of it as a clever way of improving on the
encryption model we used last time, not by simply improving it as it exists, but by completely
sidestepping the security problems it&nbsp;had.
</p>

<p>
This post will introduce a pristine version of <span class="caps">RSA</span>, without the real-world complications, and apply
it to the same problem we looked at last time: securely sending a message to someone else over an
insecure channel, without prior communication. In the future, I&#8217;ll look at how this textbook <span class="caps">RSA</span>
fails in the real world, and additionally how you can use the idea behind <span class="caps">RSA</span> to do things besides
sending secure&nbsp;messages.

As I&#8217;ve previously discussed, I&#8217;m fascinated by the ability to create proofs or solutions for
problems that are easy to understand but difficult to synthesize. In this series, I&#8217;m trying to shed
some limited insight on how we mere mortals can arrive at these beautiful and creative&nbsp;insights.

How can we send secure messages through insecure&nbsp;channels?

<p>
A quick note before we begin: this summarizes a talk I gave at my high school&#8217;s computer science
club. It&#8217;s written to be accessible to anyone with a basic math background, though, and it doesn&#8217;t
require any programming knowledge. This is the start of a series that will try to explain the basics
of cryptography: given that all of us use cryptography every day, it&#8217;s important to have a basic
understanding of how it works. It&#8217;s also pretty&nbsp;cool!

As I mentioned <a href="https://nicholas-miklaucic.github.io/posts/pactf-2019-writeup-denial-of-service-attack/">in this post</a>, I wrote several problems for <span class="caps">PACTF</span> 2019, a cybersecurity and
programming competition held for high schoolers. I&#8217;ve been asked to do writeups for each of the
problems I did, and so I&#8217;ll be trying to do that—at least, where I think there&#8217;s something
interesting to talk about for the people reading this who didn&#8217;t compete and don&#8217;t care about the&nbsp;contest.

There are a lot of clever proofs in mathematics and computer science. I&#8217;ve already talked about some
of them, and I hope to do a lot more of it on this blog. There&#8217;s often a certain separation that I
feel when I read something particularly creative or beautiful: this is amazing, but how could I ever
hope to produce something like it? Is real aesthetic achievement in these fields limited to those
with a natural talent I&nbsp;lack? 
</p>

<p>
I&#8217;m still not sure about that last question, but I do know that, like anything, it is possible to
improve at creative problem-solving through practice. The people I&#8217;ve known who have been best at
doing creative math—the kind that makes perfect sense when you see it but seems impossible to find
if you don&#8217;t already know it—have built up vast toolboxes of concepts and ideas that are useful in
many different ways across mathematics and computer science. These aren&#8217;t solutions for a single
problem: they&#8217;re meta-solutions that serve as an archetype for solutions to a diverse array of
problems. In my experience, the size of that toolbox is what, more than anything else, determines
how effectively one can find creative, novel ways of approaching problems. I&#8217;ll be talking about one
such tool today:&nbsp;invariants.

Last year, I led the team behind <a href="https://2019.pactf.com/"><span class="caps">PACTF</span> 2019</a>, a <span class="caps">CTF</span> competition where people, mostly high schoolers,
solved problems based on computers and computer security. It was a really fun and rewarding
experience, and I think a lot of people hopefullly had fun solving the problems. If that sounds like
something you might like, I&#8217;d recommend trying it out: make an account and see what you can do! I
wrote about a dozen problems for this contest, and so you&#8217;ll see some overlapping themes with what I
talk about on this&nbsp;blog.
</p>

<p>
Someone recently asked me to write up my explanation for one of the problems I wrote: &#8220;Denial of
Service Attack&#8221;, one of the harder problems in the second week.  You&#8217;re welcome to try the problem
on the <span class="caps">PACTF</span> website in full before we begin. I will be spoiling the whole thing here: you&#8217;ve been
warned! I&#8217;ll start with a brief overview, give some background, and go over the main&nbsp;trick.

Hello&nbsp;again! 
</p>

<p>
Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve been working on your dataviz skills, and you think you&#8217;ve found an interesting
pattern or correlation in a dataset. How can you tell that whatever you&#8217;re seeing is significant?
How can you distinguish between random variation and legitimate, meaningful results? As it happens,
the mathematical branch of statistics is almost entirely devoted to questions like these. I think
aspiring data scientists need not be full-fledged statisticians, but everyone should be familiar
with the basic statistical tests, when to apply them, and how to interpret their&nbsp;results.
</p>

<p>
Today we&#8217;ll be sojourning through the land of statistical tests in Python, showing how they might be
used and interpreted. The goal is not that you&#8217;ll be able to apply this all immediately when you
need it; instead, the goal is that you can recognize when statistical tests might be useful and be
able to find the ones you need. (In an age of the Internet, I find recognition to be much more
important than memorizing everything: if you know what to Google, you can figure out how to code it,
but you can&#8217;t Google something you can&#8217;t put into words or something you can&#8217;t&nbsp;recognize.)

Data visualization and data science is a hot topic right now, and there&#8217;s lots of people I know who
want to develop this skill set. A common hurdle, in my experience, is that a lot of tutorials are
either incredibly specific (here&#8217;s how to change the y-axis title) or very abstract (this is what a
violin plot is, good luck making one!) The goal of this tutorial is to make the kind of resource I
would have really benefited from when I was starting out: an introduction that can give you the
background you need to actually benefit from internal documentation and give you an idea of what&#8217;s
possible so you aren&#8217;t reinventing the wheel (an extraordinarily common problem). This post is
written&nbsp;for:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People who aren&#8217;t completely new to computer programming, but not necessarily programmers or software developers
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You need to know basic Python syntax to follow along, but you don&#8217;t need to actually know much about&nbsp;Python</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anyone who is tired of the limitations of programs like Tableau and wants to be able to make
bespoke visualizations that meet their specific&nbsp;needs</li>
<li>Those who are interested in using Python for statistics or machine learning who want some
wider background before they&nbsp;start</li>
<li>Students or presenters of any kind who want to make beautiful graphs without fighting Excel for
an&nbsp;hour</li>
</ul>
<p>
If any of these describe you, you&#8217;ve come to the right&nbsp;place!
